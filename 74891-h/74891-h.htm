<h2 class="nobreak lsp2" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="r10">

<p class="p2 noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign’s
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,—on
their sufferings,—and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
Richard Cannon, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General’s
Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>—an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,—victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow-citizens in arms,—a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,—will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION<br>

<span class="fs60">TO</span><br>

<span class="fs120 lsp2">THE INFANTRY.</span></h2>


<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<em>men-at-arms</em>,” and sixty “<em>shot</em>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <i>Crecy</i>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:—the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <i>Poictiers</i>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V, with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <i>Agincourt</i>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,—intrepidity which no danger
can appal,—unconquerable spirit and resolution,—patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,—have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> “Under the blessing of Divine Providence, His Majesty ascribes
the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in Egypt to
that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but His Majesty
desires it may be most solemnly forcibly impressed on the consideration
of every part of the army, that it has been a strict observance of
order, discipline, end military system, which has given the full energy to
the native valour of the troops, and has enabled them proudly to assert
the superiority of the national military character, in situations uncommonly
arduous, and under circumstances of peculiar difficulty.”—<em>General
Orders in 1801.</em></p>

<p>In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards
Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the successful result
of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January, 1809, it is stated:—“On
no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. There have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves: and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,—that no circumstances can appal,—and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means.”</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">The French Revolution, which commenced in the year
1789, by its destroying and sanguinary course, menaced
Europe with universal anarchy. On the 21st of
January, 1793, Louis XVI. was decapitated, and on
the 1st of February the National Convention declared
war against Great Britain and Holland.</p>

<p>Augmentations were in consequence made to the
army; volunteer companies were formed by the
patriotism of the British people, and every exertion
was made to defend those institutions which had
raised England to a high position among the nations
of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>To these events the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment owes
its origin. A letter of service was addressed to the Duke
of Gordon on the 10th of February, 1794, authorizing
him to raise a regiment in Scotland, and the commission
of Lieut.-Colonel Commandant was conferred
upon his son the Marquis of Huntly.</p>

<p>The establishment of the regiment was directed to
consist of one lieut.-colonel commandant, two majors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
ten captains, one captain-lieutenant, twenty-one lieutenants,
eight ensigns, one adjutant, quarter-master,
surgeon, assistant-surgeon, chaplain, serjeant-major,
quarter-master serjeant, forty serjeants, twenty drummers,
two fifers, and one thousand rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, 1794, the regiment was embodied
at Aberdeen, and was generally known as “<em>The
Gordon Highlanders</em>;” the regiment was inspected on
the following day by Lieut.-General Sir Hector Munro,
K.B., who expressed himself highly pleased with the
general appearance of the corps.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, the regiment embarked at Fort
George for England, and landed at Southampton on
the 16th of August, when it was encamped on Netley
Common. About this period it was numbered the
<i>Hundredth</i> regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>The uniform of the officers was as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacket.</span>—Scarlet, facings yellow, with lappels turned
back, and laced two and two; lace, silver, with a blue
silk-worm in the centre; flat buttons, silver or plated,
with the number of the regiment ‘100’ in the centre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epaulets.</span>—Two for all ranks, of silver bullion,
having two stripes of yellow silk in the centre of the
strap, with a thistle, and a binding of blue round the
edge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waistcoat.</span>—Scarlet, with regimental buttons, and
laced with silver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belted Plaid.</span>—Twelve yards of blue, black, and
green tartan, with a narrow yellow stripe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Purse, Shoes, and Hose.</span>—Badger skin, ornamented
with six white tassels, mounted with silver, and having
a rim of silver round the top. The shoes were low-quartered,
with silver buckles. The rosettes and
garters were of red tape. The hose were tartan of
white and red chequer.</p>

<p>The sword was the Highland claymore; the sword
belt of buff leather, and the breastplate oval, of silver,
ornamented with a crown and thistle, encircled by
the words “<em>Gordon Highlanders</em>.”</p>

<p>The sash was of crimson silk, and was worn across
the left shoulder. The bonnet was ornamented with
black ostrich feathers, and the dirk was silver mounted.</p>

<p>The dress of the serjeants and privates was similar,
the arms of the former being the claymore and halbert,
and the latter had muskets; queues were worn by
officers and men.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, the regiment embarked at
Southampton for Gibraltar, where it landed on the
27th of October: at this station the drill of the regiment
was completed, and it was immediately placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
on the garrison roster. The effective strength consisted
of three field officers, seven captains, nine lieutenants,
six ensigns, four staff, twenty-nine serjeants,
twenty-one drummers, and seven hundred and twenty-seven
rank and file.</p>

<p>In December the regiment received its colours on
Windmill Hill, after being consecrated by the garrison
chaplain; the regiment was marched under them by
files in ordinary time, previously to which the Marquis
of Huntly made a very impressive address, calling the
attention of the officers and men to the duties which
their King and Country expected from them, and to
the honors which he trusted they would acquire under
these banners.</p>

<p>The first or King’s Colour was, as usual, the Great
Union. The second, or Regimental Colour, was composed
of yellow silk; in the centre of both, the number
‘100,’ surmounted with a crown, and the words “<em>Gordon
Highlanders</em>,” the whole within a wreath of thistles
and roses.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1795</div>

<p>On the 11th of June, 1795, the regiment embarked
for Corsica, and landed at Bastia on the 11th of July.</p>

<p>In February of the previous year a landing was
effected in Corsica by the allied troops, and, through
the influence of General Paoli, the Commander-in-Chief
of the island, a decree was made by the Assembly
of Deputies, declaring the separation of Corsica from
France, and its union to the British dominions.</p>

<p>In December, 1795, Lieut.-Colonel the Marquis of
Huntly obtained leave of absence, and the command
of the regiment devolved on Major Erskine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>The regiment was inspected on the 14th of April,
1796, at Bastia, by Lieut.-General Thomas Trigge,
commanding at Corsica, who expressed his gratification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
at the appearance of the men, and the very correct
manner in which they performed the different movements.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May, His Excellency the Viceroy,
Lieut.-General Sir Gilbert Eliott reviewed the regiment,
and signified his highest approbation of its
appearance.</p>

<p>On the following day, the greater portion of the
regiment, under the command of Major Alexander
Napier, to which rank he had been promoted in March
of this year, proceeded to <i>Corte</i>, in order to suppress a
serious rebellion which broke out in that part of the
island, and upon the return of the troops, a general
order was issued by Lieut.-General the Honorable
John Thomas De Burgh, who had succeeded to the
command of the forces in Corsica, expressive of his best
thanks for the exertions and good conduct displayed
during the above fatiguing service.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Commandant the Marquis of Huntly
was promoted to the rank of colonel of the regiment on
the 3rd of May, 1796; Major Charles Erskine was
also promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, the commission
of the latter being ante-dated 1st May of the
previous year.</p>

<p>In July Lieut.-Colonel Erskine obtained leave of
absence, and the command of the regiment devolved
upon Major Napier.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August, a detachment, consisting of
one field officer, two captains, four subalterns, seven
serjeants, eight corporals, and two hundred privates,
was ordered to be held in readiness at a moment’s
notice, to embark upon a secret expedition. The zeal
and spirit of the corps showed itself in a most conspicuous
manner, by the unanimous wish of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
to be employed upon it; and in consequence of which,
Major Napier, then commanding the regiment, made
an offer to that effect to the Commander-in-Chief, who
was pleased to give the following <span class="nowrap">answer:—</span></p>

<p>“The Commander-in-Chief is sensible of the zeal
and laudable motive, which have induced the officers
and men of the Hundredth regiment to offer their
services on the present occasion, and he desires Major
Napier to express his best thanks to them, as well
as his assurance, that he will be ready at all times to
testify his satisfaction at their general good conduct
and appearance, although circumstances will not at
this time allow him to avail himself of their services
to the extent they offer them.”</p>

<p>This expedition proved to be against <i>Porto Ferrajo</i>,
in the Isle of Elba, and was completely successful,
without any loss on the part of the troops employed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the brilliant career of General Bonaparte
in Italy had produced a change of sentiment among
the inhabitants of Corsica, of which island he was a
native. The Corsicans, therefore, gloried in him as a
man who reflected honor on their country, and they
regretted that the island had been annexed to Great
Britain, as this event placed them in hostility to their
victorious countryman, and they began to concert
measures to effect its separation. It appearing evident
that the expense of the defence would exceed the
advantage derived from the possession of the island,
the British troops were withdrawn, and on the 6th of
September the regiment embarked for Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The regiment mustered one major, five captains,
seven lieutenants, five ensigns, three staff, thirty-seven
serjeants, twenty-one drummers, and seven hundred
and six rank and file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>The following General Order was issued upon this <span class="nowrap">occasion:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">
<i>5th September, 1796.</i></p>

<p>“The Hundredth regiment being to embark for
Gibraltar, Lieut.-General De Burgh cannot suffer
them to leave Corsica, without testifying his approbation
and satisfaction of their general good conduct
and soldier-like behaviour, since he had the honor to
command them; at the same time he desires they
will accept of his best wishes for their success and
welfare on all occasions.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the voyage, the British Admiral fell in with
a large fleet of Spanish men-of-war, and the first intimation
he had of Spain being at war with Great
Britain, was their firing upon his ships. Perceiving this,
and the enemy being so superior in force, he made
signal to crowd all sail. The Spaniards, however,
captured the “Granby” transport, having on board
two staff officers, three serjeants, and forty-eight rank
and file of the regiment.</p>

<p>The regiment landed at Gibraltar on the 4th of
October, and on the 10th of that month was inspected
by the Lieut.-Governor, who was much pleased with
its appearance.</p>

<p>In the previous year, Prussia had concluded a peace
with the French Republic, and in consequence of the
United Provinces of Holland having leagued with
France, England had taken possession of the Cape of
Good Hope and of Ceylon. The former allies of
England now became converted into enemies. War
was declared by Holland, which had been constituted
the Batavian Republic, against Great Britain, in May,
and Spain followed the example in October. In the
same month, Lord Malmsbury was sent to Paris to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
negociate a peace on the part of the British Government;
but the French insisted upon retaining, as
integral parts of the Republic, the conquests lately
made; these terms could not be acceded to consistently
with the general interests of Europe, and the negociation
was discontinued.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1797</div>

<p>In April, 1797, Lieut.-Colonel Erskine arrived at
Gibraltar, and assumed the command of the regiment.</p>

<p>In April, the preliminaries of peace were signed at
Leoben, in Styria, between Austria and the French
Republic, so that Great Britain was left to continue
the contest single-handed with France and her allies.
In July Lord Malmsbury was sent a second time to
negociate a peace, but the demands of the French
Directory rendered the attempt abortive. On the 17th
of October the definitive treaty of peace between
Austria and the French Republic was signed at Campo
Formio.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>The regiment embarked in transports for England
on the 16th of March, 1798. The ships put into the
Tagus on the 9th of April, and sailed again on the 15th.
After a tedious and boisterous passage, the regiment
disembarked at Portsmouth on the 15th of May, and
occupied Hilsea Barracks.</p>

<p>The effective strength of the regiment at this period
consisted of two field officers, four captains, eleven
subalterns, three staff, thirty-seven serjeants, twenty-two
drummers, and seven hundred and forty-two rank
and file.</p>

<p>By a General Order, dated 26th of May, 1798, it was
directed that the coats of the army should be worn
buttoned over the body down to the waist.</p>

<p>On the 31st of May, the regiment embarked in ships
of war at Southsea Beach, Portsmouth, for Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and arrived at Dublin, on the 15th of June, where it
went into barracks.</p>

<p>His Majesty King George III., appointed Colonel
the Marquis of Huntly to serve as a Brigadier-General
upon the Staff of the Army in Ireland, in
which country a spirit of discontent had been fomented
by a party of unprincipled men, who had expected aid
from France to carry out their designs. On the 21st
of June, Lieut.-General Lake defeated the main body
of the rebels at Vinegar hill, and the troubles in
Ireland would have subsided, had it not been for the
expected aid to be derived from France.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, the regiment marched at a
moment’s notice, in consequence of the disturbed state
of the country, the urgency of the service being such
that the troops were conveyed in carriages.</p>

<p>The regiment encamped in the vicinity of Gorey on
the 7th of July, and on the 18th marched suddenly to
Blessington, where it encamped. On the 29th it
marched and encamped at the Glen of Emall.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August, Lieut.-Colonel Erskine and
<ins class="corr" id="tn-9" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'three hunded'">
three hundred</ins> men were detached and encamped at
Torbay.</p>

<p>The following letter, expressive of the good conduct
of the regiment during their stay at Gorey, was
addressed by the Dean of Ferns, to Colonel the
Marquis of <span class="nowrap">Huntly:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</div>

<p><span class="pad2">“I have</span> the honor of enclosing to you that part
of the proceedings in the last vestry, held in Gorey,
wherein your Lordship and your regiment are
mentioned. This mark of our respect and gratitude
should have been sooner expressed and conveyed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
you, had not our calamitous situation delayed the
calling of a vestry, which we conceived the most regular
mode of expressing our sentiments collectively.</p>

<p>“It may be pleasing to your Lordship to hear that,
in the attendance of my parish, I have heard all the
poor loud in the praise of the honesty and humanity
of the privates of your regiment. They not only did
not rob them of the wretched pittance that was left
by the rebels, but refused such trifling presents (of
provisions, &amp;c.,) as were offered them, saying their
King paid them nobly, and enabled them to supply
every want at their own expense.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr6">“I have the honor to be,</span><br>

“<i>Dean of Ferns</i>.”</p>


<p class="p1">“We the loyal inhabitants of the parish and vicinity
of Gorey, in vestry assembled, beg leave thus publicly
to acknowledge the goodness and humanity evinced
by the Marquis of Huntly, during his short stay
amongst us. We are proud to add, that during that
short stay, rapine ceased to be a system, and the
confidence of the people in the honor of government
began to revive. We should be wanting in gratitude
if we omitted our testimony, that the humanity
of the colonel was emulated by the soldiers, and we
request the Hundredth regiment to accept our thanks
for the moderation and honor which marked the
conduct of every individual officer and private who
composed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>The French, to the number of about nine hundred
men, commanded by General Humbert, landed at
Killala, and being joined by a few malcontents marched
to Castlebar.</p>

<p>On the 24th of August the regiment marched to
Blessington; on the 26th encamped at Kilbeggan; on
the 28th at Athlone; on the 29th at Ballymore, in a
position in front of the town; on the 1st of September
it encamped at Crophill, and moved every day until
the 16th, when it encamped near Moat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the united French and rebel force had
been attacked by Lieut.-General Lake, at Ballinamuck,
on the 8th of September, and the French troops were
compelled to surrender at discretion.</p>

<p>Major-General John Moore, in brigade orders, dated
25th of September, 1798, after detailing some irregularity
on the part of the troops, added—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Major-General must, in justice to the Hundredth
regiment, state, that hitherto he has had no
complaint of any one of them, nor has he ever met
them in town after the retreat beating.”</p>
</div>

<p>The thanks of both Houses of Parliament were, on
the 15th of October, conveyed to the troops, “for their
meritorious exertions on the present important
crisis.”</p>

<p>While the regiment was encamped near Moat, the
following order was received, by which the corps was
numbered the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

and the Peninsula, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, in
subsequent years, acquired great renown, was now
rising, step by step, to that imperial sway which he
afterwards attained. The National Convention had
been succeeded in October, 1795, by the French
Directory, and the latter, jealous of Bonaparte’s popularity,
sent him, in May, 1798, on the expedition to
Egypt. Napoleon took Alexandria by storm, and
soon established himself at Cairo. The Sublime
Porte, incensed by the invasion of Egypt, declared war
against France, and formed an alliance with Russia.
The fleet which had conveyed the expedition to Egypt,
was almost destroyed by Admiral Nelson in Aboukir
Bay, on the 1st of August. So large a portion of the
French army, being thus secluded in a distant land,
gave fresh impulse to the allies, and in November the
island of Minorca surrendered to the British arms. In
December, 1798, the co-operation of Russia against
France was secured by Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>War was declared by the French Directory against
Austria, in March, 1799, and the combined Austrian
and Russian armies recovered the greater portion of
Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Great Britain now determined to make a corresponding
attempt, in conjunction with Russia, to recover
Holland from the dominion of France, and a numerous
army was selected to proceed to that country under
His Royal Highness the Duke of York, previous to
whose arrival, the troops were to be commanded by
Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby.</p>

<p>A plan of co-operation was concerted between Great
Britain and Russia, in the expectation that the Dutch
would rise in arms against the French, in favour of the
Prince of Orange, and, aided by the Anglo-Russian
force, would exert themselves to effect their emancipation.</p>

<p>On the 15th of June, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment,
which had been selected to embark on the expedition
to Holland, commenced its march by divisions for
Cork, on which day the following address was received
by the commanding <span class="nowrap">officer:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At a numerous meeting of the inhabitants of Athlone
and its vicinity on the 15th June, 1799, Thomas Mitchell,
Esq., in the chair: the following Address to
Lieut.-Colonel Erskine, commanding His Majesty’s
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment in this garrison, was unanimously
agreed <span class="nowrap">to:—</span></p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</div>

<p>“We heard with concern, that His Majesty’s
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, which you have commanded
in this garrison, has been ordered to march
for the purpose of joining those troops intended for
a foreign expedition: but however we may regret
your departure, we are not surprised that a regiment,
so eminently conspicuous for its steadiness and discipline,
should be selected for an arduous enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“We have during your continuance amongst us,
experienced a polite attention from the officers of
your regiment, and the uninterrupted peace and
tranquillity, which have prevailed in this town and
neighbourhood, evince the attention of the soldiers
under your command.</p>

<p>“Permit us, therefore, to return you our thanks, and
to request that you will convey the same to the
officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers of
your regiment.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr4">“By order of the meeting,</span><br>
(Signed)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “<span class="smcap">Thomas Mitchell</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The regiment arrived at Cork on the 24th and 25th
of June, and encamped at Monkstown, until orders for
its embarkation should arrive. On the 19th of July,
the regiment embarked at Cove, and arrived at Dover
on the 30th, when it encamped on Barham Downs,
where the troops were assembling for the expedition to
Holland under the orders of Lieut.-General Sir Ralph
Abercromby.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment was placed in the
fourth brigade, commanded by Major-General, afterwards
Sir John Moore, which consisted of the Royals
(second battalion), twenty-fifth, forty-ninth, seventy-ninth,
and <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiments.</p>

<p>The regiment marched for Ramsgate on the 7th of
August, and on the following day embarked in transports,
which sailed on the 11th for the coast of Holland.
Its effective strength consisted of one colonel, one lieut.-colonel,
two majors, six captains, twelve lieutenants,
seven ensigns, five staff, forty serjeants, twenty-one
drummers, and seven hundred and thirty rank and
file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The British troops landed on the Dutch coast, near
the <i>Helder</i>, on the 27th of August. A considerable
body of French and Dutch troops assembled near the
point of debarkation; some sharp fighting occurred,
and in the evening the enemy retreated to a position
six miles in his rear. Although one of the first to get
a footing on the Dutch shores, it did not fall to the
lot of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> to be materially engaged
this day in the affairs on the sand-hills. The regiment
had one serjeant and fourteen rank and file
drowned in the landing on the Dutch coast. The
enemy having abandoned his fortifications, and evacuated
the town during the night, the regiment moved
into Helder on the 28th of August. A numerous
train of heavy and field artillery was found in this important
post; two days afterwards the Dutch fleet
surrendered without striking a blow, and hoisted the
colours of the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>On the 1st of September, the regiment marched
out of Helder, and on the 2nd advanced to Oude
Sluys, on the Zuyder Zee, where the army took up
a position, along which the troops were placed in
cantonments, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> being in advance of
the right.</p>

<p>The Dutch did not manifest a disposition to rise
against the French. At daylight, in the morning of
the 10th of September, the united French and Dutch
forces, under General Brune, attacked the piquets;
the troops repaired to their alarm-posts, and the
action soon became general: the British troops repulsed
the attack, and the orders of that day directed
the regiment to its cantonments at Oude Sluys, and
conveyed the thanks of General Sir Ralph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Abercromby<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for its “noble and steady conduct during the
day.”</p>

<p>Captain the Honorable John Ramsay was wounded
in this action, which was fought near the villages of
<i>Crabbendam</i> and <i>Schagen</i>.</p>

<p>Field Marshal His Royal Highness the Duke of
York arrived at the Helder on the 14th of September,
and, having been reinforced by a corps of twelve
thousand Russians, under Lieut.-General Hermann,
resolved on attacking the French position in advance
of <i>Alkmaar</i>, reaching from Zuyder Zee, on the right,
to Camperdown on the left, and embracing the town
of Bergen. The attack was made on the 19th of September,
in four columns, but the Russians having
failed in holding Bergen, after having entered it in
gallant style, the places, which had been acquired by
the other columns, were abandoned, and His Royal
Highness withdrew his army to its former position on
the Zuype.</p>

<p>From the 20th of September until the 1st of October
both armies remained within their entrenchments,
strengthening their lines of defence: the French had
received reinforcements, and had inundated a large
tract of country on their right by cutting the sluices,
thus contracting the ground of operations to six or
seven miles.</p>

<p>The Duke of York, on the 2nd of October, made
another attempt on the French position, between
Bergen and <i>Egmont-op-Zee</i>. The combined attacks
were made in four columns: the division under General
Sir Ralph Abercromby being on the right, marched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
along the beach. The left of the French army was
posted and concentrated about Bergen, a large village
surrounded by extensive woods, through which passed
the great road leading to Haarlem; between which and
the sea was an extensive region of high sand-hills, impassable
for artillery. Behind the sand-hills, and to
the enemy’s right, through the whole extent of North
Holland, lies a wet and low country, intersected with
dykes, canals, and ditches.</p>

<p>The army advanced before daylight to attack the
enemy. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment was ordered to
escort twenty pieces of artillery to the front, along the
sea-shore. In the performance of this duty it was
attacked by a column of nearly six thousand men at
<i>Egmont-op-Zee</i>, where a most sanguinary conflict
ensued, immediately under the eye of General Sir
Ralph Abercromby.</p>

<p>Trusting to their superior numbers the French advanced
with resolution, and fairly met the bayonets of
the regiment, now commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Erskine, Colonel the Marquis of Huntly having been
wounded in the charge, which completely overthrew
the enemy, and preserved the guns.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The French centre was supported by the town of
<i>Alkmaar</i>, and General Sir Ralph Abercromby had
passed Bergen in order to turn the French position at
Alkmaar, to which place the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, immediately
after the brilliant affair, before recorded, advanced.
As the men fought hand-to-hand, the conflict was
signalized by many feats of individual bravery and
devoted courage.</p>

<p>The action was maintained with great obstinacy on
both sides until night, when the enemy retired, leaving
the British masters of the field of battle.</p>

<p>In the despatch of His Royal Highness the Duke of
York, dated Zuyper Sluys, 4th of October, it was stated
that, “the points where this well-fought battle were
principally contested, were from the sea-shore in
front of Egmont, extending along the sandy desert,
or hills, to the heights above Bergen, and it was sustained
by the British columns, under those highly
distinguished officers, General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
and Lieut.-General Dundas, whose exertions,
as well as the gallantry of the brave troops they led,
cannot have been surpassed by any former instance of
British valour.”</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had Captain William McIntosh,
Lieutenants George Fraser, Gordon McCardy, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
sixty-five rank and file killed; Colonel the Marquis of
Huntly, Captains John Cameron, Alexander Gordon,
John McLean, and Peter Grant, Lieutenants Norman
McLeod, Charles Chad, Donald McDonald, Charles
Cameron, and John McPherson, Ensigns George William
Holmes, James Bent, and two hundred and eight
rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The gallant conduct evinced by the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
on this occasion was afterwards rewarded with the
Royal authority to bear the word <i>Egmont-op-Zee</i> on the
regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief, in
the General Order of the 5th of October, at Alkmaar,
expressed “his warmest thanks for the steady persevering
gallantry of their conduct in the general action
of the 2nd instant, and to which he ascribes the
complete victory gained over the enemy;” and, with
the rest of the army, the regiment received the thanks
of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>The regiment, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Erskine, subsequently shared in the general operations
of the army, but was not engaged in any very serious
affair.</p>

<p>The gallant exertions made on behalf of the Dutch
were not seconded by them; and in the meantime the
French army had been reinforced. Instead, therefore,
of fighting for a people who were not resolved to be
free, it was decided that the British troops should be
withdrawn from Holland. A convention was ultimately
concluded with General Brune at Alkmaar on the
18th of October, and on the following day a cessation
of hostilities was proclaimed.</p>

<p>The regiment marched on the 28th of October to
Colenzugby, near the Helder, embarked the same day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
on board of His Majesty’s ships “Kent” and “Monarch,”
and landed at Yarmouth on the day following. Its
effective strength consisted of twenty-four serjeants,
twenty drummers, and four hundred and forty-six rank
and file.</p>

<p>During the campaign from the 27th of August to
the 28th of October, the regiment sustained a loss of
three officers and ninety-three rank and file, several of
the wounded soldiers having died.</p>

<p>On the 4th of November the regiment marched <i lang="fr">en
route</i> to Chelmsford, where it arrived on the 10th, and
was placed in the eighth brigade, the command of
which Major-General Moore assumed on the 25th of
December 1799.</p>

<p>Here the regiment received canvas knapsacks, painted
yellow, having a circle of red in the centre, in which
the Crown and Thistle, with the words “<em>Gordon
Highlanders</em>,” were inserted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte having returned from Egypt
to Paris in the previous year, had been appointed First
Consul of France, and made overtures for peace; but
the British Ministry, considering that the French
government had not acquired sufficient stability, showed
no desire to accede to the proposal.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April, 1800, orders were issued for
the regiment to hold itself in readiness to march at the
shortest notice; the first division marched on the 12th,
and was followed by the others on the 14th and 15th,
for the Isle of Wight, where it arrived on the 23rd of
April.</p>

<p>The regiment, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Erskine, marched for Cowes on the 27th of May, and
embarked on the same day in vessels of war. The head-quarters,
and five companies in His Majesty’s ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
“Diadem,” sailed on the 30th. The officers and men
present with the regiment consisted of one lieut.-colonel,
two majors, seven captains, sixteen lieutenants,
six ensigns, six staff, thirty-six serjeants, twenty-two
drummers, and six hundred rank and file.</p>

<p>The regiment disembarked at the Isle de Houat, on
the coast of France, on the 7th of June, where it encamped,
under the command of Brigadier-General the
Honorable Thomas Maitland.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment
embarked on board His Majesty’s ship “Terrible,” destined
with others to make an attack on Belle-Isle, but
which was abandoned; on the 20th the regiment disembarked,
and occupied its former encampment on the
Isle de Houat.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> embarked on the 23rd of June,
with other regiments for the Mediterranean, under the
command of Colonel the Earl of Dalhousie, of the
Second, or the Queen’s Royals, in His Majesty’s ship
“Diadem,” and arrived at Port Mahon, in the Island
of Minorca, on the 20th of July.</p>

<p>General Sir Ralph Abercromby, K.B., arrived at
Minorca on the 4th of August, and took the command
of the troops there assembled. The regiment disembarked
on the 7th, and was inspected, on the 11th of
August, by Sir Ralph Abercromby.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment embarked at George’s
Town on the 30th of August, and sailed on the following
day. After touching at Gibraltar, it proceeded to
<i>Cadiz</i>, arrived in the bay on the 3rd of October,—and
made preparations to land. The enemy, however, sent
a flag of truce, but a disease was ravaging the city at
the time, and the fleet quitted the coast in order to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
infection, proceeding afterwards to Gibraltar, where it
arrived on the 29th of October.</p>

<p>The regiment arrived at Minorca on the 6th of
November, sailed again on the 21st, and anchored at
Malta on the 1st of December. This island, after a
blockade of two years, had been compelled by famine,
to surrender in September, 1800, to Great Britain.</p>

<p>The British Government having resolved to effect
the expulsion of the French from Egypt, an army<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
amounting to about fifteen thousand men, of which the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> formed part, was assembled under
General Sir Ralph Abercromby, at Marmorice Bay, on
the coast of Asiatic Turkey. The regiment sailed from
Malta on the 26th of December, and arrived at Marmorice
Bay on the 29th. During the foregoing period,
the regiment was occasionally landed for exercise and
practice, as if before an enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>Some weeks were lost at Marmorice, in expectation
of receiving reinforcements of Greeks and Turks; and
the expedition did not proceed to its final destination
until the 23rd of February, 1801. On the 2nd of
March, it anchored in the Bay of Aboukir, eastward of
Alexandria; but notwithstanding all the exertions of
the navy, under Admiral Lord Keith’s orders, the
necessary arrangements could not be made for landing
the troops, until a week afterwards, in consequence of
unfavorable weather, and other obstructions.</p>

<p>A landing was effected on the 8th of March; a body
of French troops, supported by several batteries,
awaited the arrival of their opponents, but were forced
to give way in defiance of every exertion, and after
severe loss on both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Erskine, landed during the action, and took up
a position for the night on the heights of Aboukir.
The regiment mustered one lieut.-colonel, two majors,
six captains, ten lieutenants, six ensigns, six staff, fifty
serjeants, twenty-two drummers, and six hundred and
seventy-two rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 9th of March, the regiment advanced about
a mile further towards <i>Alexandria</i>. On the day following,
it marched to the heights of <i>Mandora</i>, and remained
in position, while the artillery and stores were being
landed. Nothing of importance occurred this day,
beyond a smart skirmish, as the enemy slowly retired.</p>

<p>The army again moved forward on the 12th of March,
and came in sight of the enemy, who was strongly posted
with his right to the canal of <i>Alexandria</i>, and his left
to the sea.</p>

<p>About six o’clock in the morning of the 13th of
March, the British army advanced to attack the
enemy’s position on the heights in front of <i>Mandora</i>,
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> being directed to lead the left
column into action. The enemy having opened a most
destructive fire from his artillery, enfiladed the column
to its whole depth: orders were consequently given
to deploy into line. The enemy thought this a favorable
moment, and immediately advanced to the attack.
The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, being in advance of the line, was
exposed to a very galling fire of grape-shot, and at the
same time was attacked by the 61st Demi-Brigade; the
regiment, however, continued unshaken in its advance
to the very muzzles of the guns, and succeeded in
taking two field-pieces, and one howitzer, completely
routing the enemy who defended them, and possessing
itself of the right of his position. He was forced, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
to retire to the fortified heights of Nicopolis, under
the walls of Alexandria, to which they form the principal
defence from that side.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel, afterwards General Sir Robert
Thomas Wilson, in his History of the British Expedition
to Egypt, stated that—</p>

<p>“The British had not advanced out of the wood of
date trees, which was in front of Mandora Tower,
before the enemy left the heights on which they had
been formed, and moved down by their right, commencing
a heavy fire of musketry, and from all their
cannon, on the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, which formed
the advanced guard of the left column.” After
eulogising the gallantry of the ninetieth regiment,
which formed the advanced guard of the right column,
Lieut.-Colonel Wilson, <span class="nowrap">added:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The conduct of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had been no
less meritorious. Opposed to a tremendous fire, and
suffering severely from the French line, they never
receded a foot, but maintained the contest alone,
until the marines and the rest of the line came to
their support.”</p>
</div>

<p>The gallantry and good conduct of the regiment this
day were most conspicuous, and in commemoration
thereof, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> afterwards received the
Royal Authority to bear the word “<em>Mandora</em>” on the
regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>His Majesty’s service, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment
in particular, sustained a great loss in the death
of Lieut.-Colonel Charles Erskine, who was mortally
wounded early in the action, when the command of the
regiment devolved on Major Alexander Napier.</p>

<p>The following officers were wounded: Captains Hon.
John Ramsay and Archibald McDonell; Lieutenants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Norman McLeod, Charles Dowle (mortally), Donald
McDonald, Tomlin Campbell (mortally), Alexander
Clarke (mortally), and Ronald Macdonald; Ensigns,
Peter Wilkie and Alexander Cameron; twenty-two
rank and file were killed, and seventy-seven were
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 14th of March, the army occupied the position,
from which the enemy was driven the day before,
and the troops were employed in throwing up works.
On this day, General Sir Ralph Abercromby thanked
the troops for their soldier-like and intrepid conduct,
in the action of yesterday, and particularised the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment. It may not be irrelevant
to state, that he selected the regiment to furnish the
guard at his head-quarters from his first landing in
Egypt, to the hour of his death; and the regiment was
continued by Lieut.-General (afterwards Lord)
Hutchinson, on that duty, until its final departure from
that country.</p>

<p>In consequence of the reduced state of the regiment
from sickness, and the casualties of the 13th of March,
it was ordered on the 20th of March (with the exception
of the Commander-in-Chief’s Guard), to march at
three o’clock next morning to relieve the battalion of
marines at Aboukir Castle; where the following Brigade
Order was <span class="nowrap">issued:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Major-General Coote feels extreme concern, that
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment is ordered to march to
Aboukir; he hopes they will soon return to the army,
and cannot part with that corps without requesting,
that the officers and men will accept his best thanks,
for their attention to their duty since they have been
under his command.”</p>
</div>

<p>About half an hour after the regiment commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
its march on the 21st of March for Aboukir, when the
French forces at <i>Alexandria</i>, having been augmented
by the arrival of additional troops from the interior,
advanced under General Menou, to attack the British
position. Major Alexander Napier, upon hearing the
firing, immediately countermarched the regiment, and
resumed his former station in the line, in which it was
hotly engaged throughout the day: no sooner had the
enemy retired from this struggle, and resigned the
victory to the British army, than the army became
aware of the loss it had sustained in the Commander-in-Chief,
General Sir Ralph Abercromby, who received
a mortal wound at the commencement of the
action, but which he concealed until the battle was decided.
Sir Ralph Abercromby died on the 28th of
March, and was buried at Malta.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had Captain John Cameron,
and Lieutenant James Stewart Mathison wounded;
three rank and file killed; and forty-four wounded.</p>

<p>Orders were again issued for the march of the regiment
on the following morning, provided no attack was
made by the enemy, and it accordingly marched to
<i>Aboukir</i>.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of May, the regiment marched from
Aboukir for <i>Rosetta</i>, where a Turkish force joined the
British; on the 5th it advanced along the banks of the
Nile, and continued in motion until the 16th of June,
when it arrived before <i>Grand-Cairo</i>.</p>

<p>The regiment moved to the right on the 21st of June,
and encamped before the town of <i>Gizeh</i>; one of the
gates of which place was delivered up by the French
on the 28th of June.</p>

<p>A convention with the garrison of <i>Cairo</i>, was on the
following day announced as finally adjusted, by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that place was to be delivered up to the allied army, and
the French troops to be transported to France.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July, Lieut.-General Hutchinson
communicated to the army the thanks of His Majesty,
and of both Houses of Parliament, for its determined
bravery at the landing, and in the actions of the 13th,
and 21st of March, and concluded by a warm eulogium
from himself.</p>

<p>The army marched, and retraced its steps towards
<i>Rosetta</i>. The promotion of Major Alexander Napier
to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel
Erskine, killed in the action of the 13th of
March, was announced in a manner most flattering to
the corps on the 15th of July, as will appear from the
following extract of a letter from His Royal Highness
the Duke of York, the Commander-in-Chief, dated—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The regiment arrived on the heights of <i>Aboukir</i> on
the 8th of August, and on the following day marched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to the same position which it had left on the 22nd of
March, and encamped before Alexandria.</p>

<p>The brigade under the orders of Brigadier-General
John Doyle, Colonel of the eighty-seventh regiment,
advanced before daylight on the 17th of August to attack
two redoubts, situated on the green-hill in front of
the enemy’s right, which the thirtieth and fiftieth regiments
were directed against, while the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
was placed as a reserve, and ready to support either.
This service was successfully performed with little loss to
the regiment.</p>

<p>Troops having been sent in boats on the 26th of
August to land, and break ground to the westward of
<i>Alexandria</i>, the enemy this day sent out a flag of truce,
and hostilities ceased; on the 2nd of September,
Alexandria surrendered by capitulation, which event
terminated the campaign in Egypt.</p>

<p>The British troops received the thanks of both
Houses of Parliament, and His Majesty King George
III., conferred upon the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, and other
regiments, which had thus exalted the military fame of
Great Britain, by the expulsion of the “invincible”
legions of Bonaparte from Egypt, from whence he had
expected to extend his conquests throughout Asia, the
honor of bearing on their colours and appointments
the “<span class="smcap">Sphinx</span>,” and the word “<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>,” as a distinguished
mark of His Majesty’s royal approbation of
their conduct during the campaign.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The regiment marched for Aboukir on the 6th of
October, 1801, and embarked in ships of war, which
sailed on the following day.</p>

<p>Upon the guard of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, which had
been doing duty at head-quarters, being ordered to
rejoin, the officer commanding the regiment received a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
letter expressive of Lieut.-General Hutchinson’s “entire
approbation of the exemplary conduct of the guard,
and of Serjeant Mark in particular.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of October, the regiment arrived at
Malta, and remained in harbour until the 15th of
November, when the ships sailed for the shores of Great
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>The regiment arrived at Cork on the 30th of January,
1802, and remained under quarantine at Cove, until
the 12th of February, when it landed and marched to
Kilkenny. The effective strength consisted of one
lieut.-colonel, two majors, four captains, fifteen lieutenants,
five ensigns, six staff, forty-two serjeants, twenty-two
drummers, and five hundred and fifty-nine rank
and file.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March, 1802, a definitive treaty of
peace was signed at Amiens between the French Republic,
Spain, and the Batavian Republic, on the one
part, and Great Britain on the other. The principal
features of the treaty were, that Great Britain restored
all her conquests during the war, excepting Trinidad
and Ceylon, which were ceded to her, the former by
Spain, and the latter by the Batavian Republic.
Portugal was maintained in its integrity, excepting
that some of its possessions in Guiana were ceded to
France. The territories of the Ottoman Porte were
likewise maintained in their integrity. The Ionian
Republic was recognised, and Malta was to be restored
to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. The French
agreed to evacuate the Neapolitan and Roman States,
and Great Britain all the ports that she held in the
Adriatic and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The regiment on the 5th of April received orders to
fire a <i lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i>, in consequence of the treaty of peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
concluded at Amiens. On the 12th of April, the regiment
marched from Kilkenny, and arrived at Belfast
on the 28th of that month, where it remained until the
2nd of June, when it embarked for Scotland.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June, the regiment arrived in Scotland
for the first time since it was raised, and proceeded to
Glasgow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>The peace of Amiens was of short duration; it
inspired no confidence of ultimate tranquillity, and both
parties remained prepared to renew the contest. The
chief complaint on the part of France was the non-evacuation
of Malta by the British troops, and the
asylum afforded to the enemies of the French government.
Circumstances had, however, occurred which
would have rendered the restoration of Malta to the
Knights of St. John of Jerusalem equivalent to ceding
that island to France. Other grounds of irritation
existed, and the designs of Napoleon Bonaparte to
raise the power of France by an extension of territorial
dominion, to which England appeared a barrier, caused
the struggle to be renewed; and the contest was not
settled until the final defeat of the French at the battle
of Waterloo, on the memorable 18th of June, 1815, by
the allied troops under the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May, 1803, war was declared against
France; Hanover was overrun by the French, and
severed for a time from the British crown; and the
First Consul ordered the arrest of all British subjects
in the territories of the French and Batavian republics.</p>

<p>Preparations were made by the British Government
to meet the emergency; the “<em>Army of Reserve Act</em>”
was passed in June, 1803, for raising men for home
service by ballot, by which a second battalion was
added to the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment. The second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
battalion was to be composed from the balloted men
raised in Scotland for limited service, and was
placed on the Establishment from the 9th of July
following.</p>

<p>In June, the regiment was removed from Glasgow to
Colchester, and on the 1st of July it marched to Weeley,
where it encamped while the barracks were being prepared,
which were occupied by the regiment during the
winter.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the regiment was formed at
Weeley, on the 24th of November, 1803; officers and
non-commissioned officers, with a proportion of old
soldiers, being posted to it from the first battalion for
the purpose of instruction. Both battalions were commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Napier.</p>

<p>Each battalion was to have ten companies, consisting
of fifty-four serjeants, twenty drummers, two fifers, and
a thousand rank and file.</p>

<p>At this period Bonaparte was making preparations
for the invasion of England, for which purpose he collected
an immense flotilla at Boulogne. The threat of
invasion aroused the patriotism of the British people,
and the most strenuous measures were pursued to
defeat the designs of the French Ruler; volunteer and
yeomanry corps were formed in every part of the kingdom,
and all parties united in one grand effort for the
preservation of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>In May, 1804, Napoleon was invested with the dignity
of <em>Emperor of the French</em>, and on the 26th of May, of
the following year, he was crowned at Milan as <em>King
of Italy</em>.</p>

<p>Further measures of defence were adopted by Great
Britain, and the “<em>Additional Force Act</em>” was passed on
the 14th July, 1804.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Both battalions marched to Colchester on the 24th of
July, and on the 6th of August were encamped on
Lexden Heath.</p>

<p>On the 24th of October orders were issued for the
march of one captain, one subaltern, four serjeants, four
corporals, and one drummer to Elgin, from the second
battalion, to receive the men to be raised under the
“<em>Additional Force Act</em>.”</p>

<p>Both battalions broke up from Lexden camp on the
26th of October, and marched to Weeley barracks.</p>

<p>Orders were received on the 25th of November for
the second battalion to be held in readiness to march
from Weeley barracks, and proceed by the inland
navigation to Liverpool, from whence it was to embark
for Ireland. The second battalion accordingly marched
in three divisions, on the 29th of November and on the
two following days.</p>

<p>The first battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Napier, remained in Weeley barracks during
the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>During the summer of 1805, the first battalion was
brigaded with the forty-second, ninety-first, and ninety-fifth
(Rifle) regiments. On the 2nd of September, the
battalion marched from Weeley to Colchester; on the
4th of September the first battalion was ordered to
hold itself in readiness for embarkation, but on the 6th
of September it returned to Weeley barracks.</p>

<p>The first battalion marched, on the 7th of October,
to Colchester with other troops, and was reviewed by
His Royal Highness the Duke of York, the Commander-in-Chief,
who expressed himself particularly
pleased with the appearance of the battalion, which
returned to its quarters at Weeley on the 18th of
October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>While the French were pursuing their victorious
career in Germany, they experienced great reverses from
the British navy. On the 21st of October, the combined
fleets of France and Spain were defeated off Cape Trafalgar;
but the victory was purchased with the loss of
Admiral Viscount Nelson, whose remains were honored
with a public funeral at St. Paul’s Cathedral, and the
first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment attended
the ceremony.</p>

<p>On the 29th of October, the first battalion marched
from Weeley, and arrived at Ospringe barracks on the
6th of November; on the 26th of November it marched
to Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>The first battalion marched, on the 2nd of January,
1806, to London, to attend the public funeral of Admiral
Viscount Nelson, whose remains were interred, on the
9th of January, in St. Paul’s Cathedral, where a
monument was erected by authority of Parliament at
the public expense.</p>

<p>Major-General the Hon. John Hope, from the sixtieth
regiment, (afterwards the Earl of Hopetoun,) was appointed
by His Majesty King George III. to be colonel
of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, on the 3rd of January,
1806, in succession to Major-General the Marquis of
Huntly, who was removed to the forty-second, or the
Royal Highlanders, on the decease of General Sir
Hector Munro, K.B.</p>

<p>The first battalion marched, on the 11th of January,
from London for Colchester, where it arrived on the
15th of that month: it marched to Weeley barracks on
the 29th of May, where it remained stationary, with
the exception of occasional marches to and from Colchester,
for the purpose of being exercised with other
brigades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>On the 3rd of February, 1807, the first battalion
marched from Weeley for Harwich, with the view of
checking the infection of ophthalmia, which then prevailed
among the troops at Weeley. The first battalion
returned to Weeley on the 27th of April.</p>

<p>Information having been obtained that Napoleon
purposed employing the navy of <i>Denmark</i> against
Great Britain, an armament was prepared for obtaining
possession of the Danish fleet by treaty or force, on
the assurance that it should be restored at the conclusion
of the war with France. The first battalion was
destined to share in this enterprise, and it received
orders, on the 22nd of July, to be in readiness for
foreign service.</p>

<p>The battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Napier,
marched for Harwich on the 26th of July, and embarked
on the same day, after being inspected by Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird. On the 27th a draft of one
hundred and three rank and file joined from the second
battalion: the effective strength of the first battalion
consisted of forty-eight serjeants, nineteen drummers,
and nine hundred and eighty-one rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, the expedition sailed, and on
the 8th anchored in the Sound near Elsineur. On the
following day, Lieut.-General Harry Burrard<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> directed
the army assembling in the Sound to be formed in
brigades and divisions, and that the forty-third, fifty-second,
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, and ninety-fifth (Rifle) regiments
should compose the reserve, under Major-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, until the arrival of the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Lord Cathcart arrived on the 12th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
August, and assumed the command of the army; on
the 14th the fleet sailed towards <i>Copenhagen</i>, and on the
16th of August the army landed at Vedeck, in Zealand,
situated about half-way between Elsineur and Copenhagen,
without opposition, and on the following day
the regiment went into cantonments in Hassan, and
Broomskoy. Its movements were various, and dependent
upon circumstances during this period.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment advanced towards
Roeskelde on the 26th of August, in consequence of the
enemy collecting a large force at the town of <i>Kioge</i> and
its vicinity, for the purpose of being thrown into
<i>Copenhagen</i>, which was at this time invested by the
British army.</p>

<p>On the 29th of August, the division under Major-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley advanced to attack the
Danes in their position. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Alexander
Napier, was appointed to lead the infantry against the
enemy’s camp, in which the regiment charged him,
driving him out of it, and through the town of Kioge,
with the loss of his artillery. The regiment had two
rank and file killed, and one wounded.</p>

<p>On the 30th of August, the British troops marched
to Osted, and went into cantonments. On this day,
after expressing in orders his satisfaction at the conduct
of the troops in the action of the 29th, Major-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, in particularizing those who had
an opportunity of distinguishing themselves, alluded to
the conduct of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, and of
<i>Lieut.-Colonel Napier</i>, in the attack of the enemy in
his camp, and to the regular and orderly manner in
which the troops marched through Kioge, and formed
beyond the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>The conduct of the troops employed in the action
before <i>Kioge</i> was thus alluded to in General Orders by
Lieut.-General Lord <span class="nowrap">Cathcart:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">
“<i>Head Quarters, Hellerup</i>,<br>
<i>“1st September, 1807.</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces desires to express, in
the strongest manner, his thanks to Major-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, and to the officers and men of
the division under his command, for the judgment,
valour, and discipline exhibited in the two attacks
made upon the enemy in the general action of the
29th of August at Kioge.</p>

<p>“The details of this affair, as reported by the Major-General,
will be laid before His Majesty by the
earliest opportunity.”</p>
</div>

<p>The bombardment of Copenhagen induced the Crown
Prince to listen to terms; and on the 7th of September
the Danish fleet and stores were surrendered to the
British government on condition of being restored,
when a general pacification should take place.</p>

<p>The following General Order was issued to the troops
on the same <span class="nowrap">day:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">
“<i>7th September, 1807.</i></p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces congratulates the
army on the capitulation of Copenhagen, which
includes the surrender of the Danish fleet.”</p>
</div>

<p>A detachment of grenadiers took possession of the
citadel, and hostilities ceased.</p>

<p>The object of the expedition having been accomplished,
Copenhagen was evacuated, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment marched from Osted to Roeskelde
Kroe on the 23rd of September, and on the next day
joined the army before Copenhagen, and went into
cantonments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The approbation of His Majesty, King George III.,
for the services performed during the expedition, was
expressed in the following extract from a despatch,
dated 16th September, 1807, addressed to Lieut.-General
Lord Cathcart by Viscount Castlereagh,
Principal Secretary of State for the War <span class="nowrap">Department:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His Majesty has received, with great satisfaction,
the account of the particular services rendered in their
detached commands by Major-General the Right
Hon. Sir Arthur Wellesley, Major-General Von
Linsingen, and Brigadier-General Von Decken.</p>

<p>“I am further to express His Royal pleasure, that
you do convey to the general officers under your
command His Majesty’s full approbation of the zeal,
ability, and valour they have displayed in their
several departments; and your Lordship will make
it known to the army, that the conduct of all his
troops, both British and Hanoverian, who have so
much distinguished themselves by their valour and
good conduct, is highly acceptable to His Majesty.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>“It is also a matter highly pleasing to His Majesty,
that through the whole of this expedition, such a
perfect harmony, and such a zealous spirit of co-operation,
have pervaded all departments of the naval
and military service.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Lord Cathcart in communicating
the above to the army under his command, on the 28th
of September, 1807, added,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Commander of the Forces cannot make this
communication, without renewing his thanks to the
army, for the assistance he has received from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
zeal, advice, and active services of the generals, staff,
and commanding officers, and for the patience, discipline,
and exertions of all regiments, corps, and
departments, to which, under the blessing of Providence,
he is indebted for the complete success of
the expedition, and for the most gracious approbation,
which His Majesty has been pleased to declare
of the whole service.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 17th of October, the first battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment embarked for England in the
<i>Minotaur</i>, <i>Neptunis</i>, and <i>Iris</i>, ships of war, and sailed
on the 21st. During the passage they encountered
very boisterous weather, in which the ships parted
company: unfortunately the <i>Neptunis</i>, of ninety-eight
guns (one of the captured Danish ships), with six
hundred of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment on board,
got aground, and was totally lost. The men were
landed on the island of Hewan, where they remained
for fourteen days, until vessels arrived for them from
England.</p>

<p>The men on board the head-quarter ship landed
in England on the 12th of November; and on the
arrival of the different detachments, orders were waiting
for them to proceed to Weeley barracks. The effective
strength of the first battalion at this period consisted
of forty-nine serjeants, twenty-two drummers, and nine
hundred and sixty-four rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>The first battalion marched to Colchester barracks
on the 23rd of March, 1808. Volunteers from the
militia of the northern counties were, about this time,
received, and taken on the strength of the second battalion,
which continued in Ireland.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, the first battalion of the regiment
was directed to be held in readiness for immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
embarkation for foreign service, and on the 29th of
April, it marched from Colchester, and embarked in
transports at Harwich, under Lieut.-Colonel Napier.</p>

<p>The battalion sailed for Yarmouth on the 4th of
May, and arrived there on the 6th, where an armament,
under the command of Lieut.-General Sir John Moore,
was assembling, destined to proceed to Sweden.</p>

<p>The armament sailed from Yarmouth on the 10th of
May, and anchored off <i>Gottenburg</i> on the 17th. The
Swedes did not show any inclination to avail themselves
of British assistance on shore, consequently the troops
did not disembark, but during their stay were occasionally
exercised in practising to land from launches and
flat-bottomed boats.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed for England on the 3rd of July, with
orders to rendezvous at Yarmouth. A vessel, with
orders from England, however, changed the place of
rendezvous to the Downs, where the fleet arrived on the
20th of July, and proceeded to Spithead. A draft of
seventy rank and file was received from the second
battalion.</p>

<p>Spain was at this period the centre of political
interest. Portugal, deserted by her government, and
Spain betrayed, the people of each rose in arms to
recover the national independence. Dissensions had
arisen in the royal family of Spain, occasioned by the
sway of Emanuel Godoy, who bore the title of Prince
of Peace. This minister was dismissed, but the Court
was unable to restore tranquillity. In this emergency,
the French Emperor was solicited to be umpire; and
Napoleon ultimately seized the crown of Spain, which
he placed on the head of his brother Joseph, who was
transferred from the throne of Naples. Europe was
indignant, and Spain furious, at this usurpation. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Spaniards flew to arms, and the British government
resolved to aid the Spanish and Portuguese patriots;
a British army accordingly proceeded to the Peninsula
in June, 1808, the command of which was held by
Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley.</p>

<p>On the 31st of July, having received on board a
fresh supply of provisions and water, the first battalion
sailed for Portugal, and on the 19th of August arrived
in Mondego Bay. Marshal Junot and the French
army having been defeated by the troops under Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, in the battles at <i>Roliça</i>
on the 17th, and <i>Vimiera</i> on the 21st of August, sued
for a cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>The battalion landed at Maciera Bay on the 27th
of August, and the convention of Cintra was signed on
the 30th of that month, by which it was stipulated that
the French should evacuate Portugal.</p>

<p>Portugal, being thus rescued from the presence of
hostile troops, orders arrived from England for Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore to take the chief command of
a part of the army, which was to be employed in Spain;
with a notification that a force from England, under
the command of Lieut.-General Sir David Baird, was
to land at Corunna, and co-operate with him. The
first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment was
immediately put in motion towards the frontiers, and
arrived at Portalegre on the 11th of October, 1808.</p>

<p>On the 26th of October, the first battalion, being
placed in the division commanded by Lieut.-General
Sir John Hope, moved from Portalegre, and on the
2nd of November entered Spain, at Badajoz; marching
by Merida, Truxillo, and Talavera, it arrived at
the Escurial on the 22nd of November, and halted.</p>

<p>The enemy having pressed forward to Valladolid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
and Tordesillas, thereby threatening to cut off Lieut.-General
Sir John Hope’s communication with the
army under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, who was
then at Salamanca, the battalion marched from the
Escurial, on the 27th of November, across the Guadarama
mountains, and moving by Villa Castin and
Avila, it arrived at Alva de Tormes on the 4th of
December.</p>

<p>The battalion advanced from Alva de Tormes towards
Tordesillas, on the 11th of December, and Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, learning that the French
were moving upon him from the direction of Madrid,
which had by this time surrendered, while another
column was advancing from the direction of Burgos,
moved to the left, to form a junction with Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird, crossed the Douro at Toro,
and arrived at Vallada on the 21st of December. On
the 24th of that month, the battalion marched by
Benevente, Astorga, and Villa Franca, arriving at
Lugo on the 4th of January, 1809.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The troops took up a position in front of Lugo, on
the 6th of January, 1809, and remained bivouacked,
in order of battle, until the 8th, when they marched
in the night, and arrived at <i>Corunna</i> on the 11th.
During these marches, in common with the rest of the
army, the battalion suffered from fatigue and the
severity of the weather.</p>

<p>On the 12th of January, the battalion was placed in
position in front of <i>Corunna</i>; and on the 14th and 15th
the women, sick men, and baggage, were embarked for
England.</p>

<p>The British army having accomplished one of the
most celebrated retreats recorded in modern history,
repulsing the pursuing enemy in all his attacks, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
having traversed two hundred and fifty miles of mountainous
country under very disheartening circumstances,
accompanied by severe privation, was not destined to
embark for England without a battle.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, having taken up
a position above the town of <i>Corunna</i>, made arrangements
for attacking the British army as soon as the
troops should commence their embarkation. The sick
men, women, and baggage having been conveyed on
board ship, preparations were made for embarking the
troops on the 16th of January, 1809. The French
instantly descended from the heights in three columns,
and advanced about two o’clock to attack the British
position in front of <i>Corunna</i>; a sanguinary action
ensued, and before dark, the French were defeated in
all their attacks. Lieut.-General Sir John Moore
was killed; and the battle was scarcely ended, when,
wrapped in a military cloak, his remains were interred
in the citadel of Corunna, over which Marshal Soult,
with the true feeling of a soldier, erected a monument.</p>

<p>This victory enabled the British troops to be embarked
without further molestation. In this battle
the first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was posted
towards the left of the army, on the road leading to
Betanzas, and throughout the day supported its former
reputation.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, together with the rest of the
army, had not only to lament the death of Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, but also that of their own
commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Napier,
who was killed at its head: the command therefore devolved
on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel John Lamont, who
was afterwards promoted lieut.-colonel in the regiment.
Lieutenant Archibald McDonald was severely wounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
on this occasion, and died shortly afterwards. Only
two rank and file of the battalion were killed, and four
wounded.</p>

<p>This army received the thanks of both Houses of
Parliament, “for its distinguished discipline, firmness,
and valour, in the battle of <span class="smcap">Corunna</span>,” which were
communicated to the regiment, with the following
letter, addressed to the commanding officer by Lieut.-General
Sir David <span class="nowrap">Baird:—</span></p>

</div>

<p>The conduct of the battalion during the expedition,
and its gallantry at the battle of Corunna, were rewarded
by the Royal authority for the word “<span class="smcap">Corunna</span>” to
be borne on the regimental colour and appointments
of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, in common with the army employed
under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>On the 17th of January, the battalion embarked at
Corunna, and on the 26th disembarked at Portsmouth,
marching immediately for Weeley Barracks, where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
several divisions arrived on the 13th, 14th, and 15th
of February.</p>

<p>On the 16th of February, orders were issued that
every exertion should be made to clothe and <ins class="corr" id="tn-45" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'equip the the regiment'">
equip the regiment</ins> again for foreign service. The regiment
received black painted canvas knapsacks, having the
Sphinx and number on the back.</p>

<p>About this period, Lieut.-Colonel John Cameron
joined from the second battalion, which continued in
Ireland.</p>

<p>The first battalion marched on the 29th of June for
Dover, where it arrived on the 6th and 7th of July,
and was joined by two hundred and twenty rank and
file from the second battalion.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1809 great preparations were
made by the British Government for fitting out the
most formidable armament that had, for a long time,
issued from England. It consisted of an army of forty
thousand men, commanded by Lieut.-General the
Earl of Chatham, and of thirty-nine ships of the line,
thirty-six frigates, and numerous gun-boats, bomb-vessels,
with other small craft, under Admiral Sir
Richard Strachan. The object of the expedition was
to gain possession of the islands at the mouth of the
Scheldt, and to destroy the French ships in that river,
with the docks and arsenals at Antwerp.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July, the first battalion marched to
Deal, and embarked in ships of war with other troops
there assembled, under Lieut.-General the Earl of
Chatham. The battalion, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, was placed in Major-General
Sir William Erskine’s brigade, and in the division
commanded by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope. The
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> mustered forty-four serjeants, twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
drummers, and nine hundred and seventy-four rank
and file.</p>

<p>The expedition sailed from the Downs on the 28th
of July, and landed on the 1st of August on the Island
of South Beveland, near Goes, and went into cantonments
in that place and Capelle. Flushing surrendered
on the 15th of August; but during the siege Marshal
Bernadotte had arrived at Antwerp, put the place in
a posture of defence, and removed the ships higher up
the river. In consequence of these preparations, the
reduction of Antwerp was deemed impracticable by a
Council of War, and on the 1st of September the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> embarked for England.</p>

<p>The battalion landed at Landguard Fort near Harwich,
and proceeded to Woodbridge barracks. During
the time it was in South Beveland, it suffered much
from fever and ague, with other diseases peculiar to
that place; consequently every attention was now paid
to restore the men, and to render them again fit for
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>On the 11th of July, 1810, the first battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> embarked at Landguard Fort, landed
at Ramsgate, and arrived at Canterbury on the 20th
of that month.</p>

<p>The battalion was shortly afterwards destined to
proceed a second time to the Peninsula, and it embarked
from Deal for Lisbon on the 24th of September.
Since its embarkation at Corunna, in January,
1809, great events had occurred in Spain, and the
French had obtained possession of Corunna, Bilboa,
and all the important places on the northern coast of
that country. Saragossa, after a gallant defence, had
also fallen, and Marshal Soult having overrun Gallicia,
marched into the northern provinces of Portugal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and obtained possession of Oporto. The small British
force which had been left in Portugal, when Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore advanced into Spain, was concentrated
by Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock for the
defence of Lisbon.</p>

<p>The British Government resolved to make another
effort to save Portugal from invasion, and also to assist
the Spaniards in their struggle for independence.
Accordingly in April 1809, Lieut.-General Sir Arthur
Wellesley was sent with reinforcements to Portugal,
and was appointed to the command of the British army
in the Peninsula. His first object was to dislodge
Marshal Soult from Oporto. The famous passage of
the Douro led to the fall of Oporto, and the French
Marshal was compelled to retreat. The Spanish General
Cuesta having been defeated, with great loss, by
the division of the French army under Marshal Victor,
Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley was obliged to
desist from the pursuit of Marshal Soult.</p>

<p>In the beginning of July, the British army advanced
into Spain, and a junction being effected with General
Cuesta, the combined forces occupied a strong position
at <i>Talavera</i>. Here they were attacked on the 27th
and 28th of July, 1809, and the French army, commanded
by Joseph Bonaparte in person, was defeated;
for which victory Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley
was raised to the peerage by the title of <em>Viscount Wellington</em>.</p>

<p>After this victory it was deemed necessary to make
a retrograde movement on Badajoz, information having
been received that Marshals Soult, Ney, and Victor
had united their forces, and were advancing to fall on
the rear of the allied army.</p>

<p>Viscount Wellington now became occupied with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
defence of Portugal. The French armies in Spain had
been reinforced during the winter of 1809-10 with
troops from Germany, peace having been concluded
between France and Austria; and in April, 1810, the
Emperor Napoleon espoused the Archduchess Maria
Louisa, daughter of the Emperor of Austria.</p>

<p>Spain having been reduced to French domination,
Napoleon resolved to subjugate Portugal, and Marshal
Massena, Prince of Essling, assumed the command of
the “<em>Army of Portugal</em>” in May. Ciudad Rodrigo
and Almeida were captured by the French, who were,
however, gallantly repulsed at the <i>Sierra de Busaco</i> on
the 27th of September, 1810, after which Viscount
Wellington occupied the strong position of Torres
Vedras, about thirty miles from Lisbon.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs in the Peninsula when
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> arrived in the Tagus. On the 8th
of October, the battalion landed, and the necessary
camp equipage, on taking the field, was immediately
issued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
John Cameron, marched from Lisbon to join
the army under Viscount Wellington, then in the fortified
lines of Torres Vedras, and arrived at Cruzandera
on the 15th of October, where the battalion
remained until the 15th of November. At this period
it was attached to the first division of the army, and
was brigaded with the <i>fiftieth</i> and <i>seventy-first</i> regiments,
under Major-General Howard.</p>

<p>Marshal Massena having abandoned his position in
front of the British, and retired upon Santarem, the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> advanced on the 15th of November,
and occupied the village of Almostal on the 19th of
November, moving on the 28th to Alcantrinha, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
enemy occupying a strong position at Santarem, immediately
in front of the British army.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the year 1811, Lisbon
was the point on which the interests of the British
nation in foreign affairs were concentrated, and the
question whether Portugal should remain independent,
or become subject to France, was to be decided by the
two great armies posted near Lisbon, the one for
attack, the other for defence.</p>

<p>The difficulty of supplying his troops with necessaries
in a devastated country, and the impracticability
of forcing the fortified lines of Viscount Wellington, at
Torres Vedras, at length compelled Marshal Massena
to consult the safety of his army by a seasonable
retreat.</p>

<p>During the night of the 5th of March, the enemy
broke up from his position near Santarem, and retreated
in the direction of Almeida. Viscount Wellington
immediately pursued Marshal Massena by
Thomar, Pombal, Redinha, and Espinhal, at each of
which places some sharp affairs took place, honorable
to the British arms, as well as at Sabugal on the 3rd
of April, immediately after which the French continued
their retreat into Spain.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment
entered Spain on the 9th of April, and was cantoned
in Albergaria, where a detachment of one lieutenant
and forty-four rank and file joined from the second
battalion, then in Ireland. At this period, the sixth
division of the British army invested <i>Almeida</i>, and a
force of British and Portuguese under Marshal Beresford
was employed in the Alemtejo and Spanish Estremadura,
which compelled the enemy to abandon
Campo Mayor. <i>Olivenza</i> was next besieged by Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Beresford, and retaken on the 15th of April, after
which he broke ground before <i>Badajoz</i>.</p>

<p>Marshal Massena had reached Ciudad Rodrigo on
the 25th of April, and, having concentrated his forces,
crossed the Agueda on the 2nd of May, and advanced
towards the allied army, posted between that river and
the Coa, in order to relieve <i>Almeida</i>. On the approach
of the French, the British light division and cavalry
fell back upon <i>Fuentes d’Onor</i>, where three other divisions
were posted, and in which Viscount Wellington
determined to receive the attack of the enemy.</p>

<p>The village of <i>Fuentes d’Onor</i> is situated on low
ground, at the bottom of a ravine, with an old chapel
and some buildings on a craggy eminence which overhang
one end. In the afternoon of the 3rd of May,
the enemy attacked the village with a very large force,
and was repulsed with loss. On this occasion, the light
company of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> distinguished itself.
Lieutenant James Hill was wounded; nine rank and
file were likewise wounded.</p>

<p>The main body of the British army was concentrated
in the vicinity of Fuentes d’Onor in the course of the
evening and following day. On the 5th of May, the
enemy, very superior to the British in numbers, made
an attack on the right of the allied position early in
the morning, and also on the village, which he repeated
during the day, and the action became general. Each
of his attacks was successively repulsed, and towards
the evening, the victory being decidedly in favour of
the British, the French retired to their original
position.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Cameron,
was stationed to the right of <i>Fuentes d’Onor</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
covering a brigade of nine-pounders, and was exposed
to a very heavy cannonade. The light company, and
a subdivision of each of the others in its front, were
warmly engaged throughout the day, and eminently
distinguished themselves. Major Archibald McDonnell,
who commanded them, was in consequence promoted
to the brevet rank of Lieut.-Colonel. Major Peter
Grant and Lieutenant Allan McNab were severely
wounded; the latter died two days afterwards. The
battalion had also seven rank and file killed and thirty-five
wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> afterwards received the Royal
Authority to bear the words “<span class="smcap">Fuentes d’Onor</span>” on
the regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of the gallantry displayed by the first
battalion in that battle.</p>

<p>Both armies continued in their positions during the
6th and 7th of May without any particular occurrence,
and on the morning of the 8th, the rear of the enemy’s
columns was seen retreating on the road towards
Ciudad Rodrigo. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> still remained
bivouacked near Fuentes d’Onor.</p>

<p>The French crossed the Agueda and left <i>Almeida</i> to
its fate. That place was evacuated by General
Brennier at midnight of the 10th of May, when the
enemy blew up the works, and the greater part of the
garrison succeeded in effecting its escape during the
night.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May, the battalion returned to its
former cantonments in Albergaria, where orders were
received increasing its establishment to twelve hundred
rank and file.</p>

<p>Marshal Beresford, in the meantime, was continuing
the blockade of <i>Badajoz</i>; but receiving information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
that Marshal Soult was advancing from Seville to its
relief, he raised the siege on the 15th of May, and
having concentrated his force, marched to meet the
enemy. On the following day, the battle of <i>Albuhera</i>
was fought, and the British gained a brilliant but hard-earned
victory. In the night of the 17th, Marshal
Soult left Badajoz to its fate, and commenced his
retreat towards Seville.</p>

<p>Viscount Wellington now gave orders for <i>Badajoz</i> to be
again closely invested. To assist in these operations, the
brigade, of which the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> formed part, was
appointed the first in the second division of the army,
under Lieut.-General Rowland (afterwards Viscount)
Hill, at this time in Spanish Estremadura, covering
the siege of Badajoz.</p>

<p>The battalion, under Lieut.-Colonel Cameron,
marched, on the 25th of May, from Albergaria for the
Alemtejo, crossed the Tagus at Villa Velha, and the
Guadiana above Badajoz, and joined the second division
in front of Albuhera, on the 10th of June, about ten
days after the second siege of Badajoz had been commenced.
Its effective strength consisted of fifty-six
serjeants, sixteen drummers, and eight hundred and
twenty-five rank and file.</p>

<p>Marshal Marmont, with the French army of Portugal,
having effected a junction with that of the south, under
Marshal Soult, they advanced to relieve Badajoz;
Viscount Wellington found it therefore necessary to
relinquish the siege, and to withdraw the allied army
across the Guadiana.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the second division, on the 16th of
June, broke up from its bivouac in front of Albuhera,
marched by Valverde, recrossed the Guadiana, and
arrived at Torre do Mouro on the 20th of June, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the principal part of the British army was drawn up
in position, with its right upon Elvas and the left on
Campo Mayor. The division broke up from the
bivouac at Torre do Mouro on the 21st of July, marched
to Elvas, and on the following day went into quarters
in Borba, from whence it marched on the 1st of September,
arriving on the 3rd of that month at Portalegre.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main body of the army, under
Viscount Wellington, had crossed the Tagus and invested
<i>Ciudad Rodrigo</i>. Towards the end of September,
Marshal Marmont, having received large reinforcements,
advanced to Ciudad Rodrigo, and, after
a partial engagement at El Bodon on the 25th of
September, Viscount Wellington withdrew his army to
his former position on the Coa.</p>

<p>On the 7th of October, a draft of one hundred and
ninety-nine rank and file was received from the second
battalion.</p>

<p>The second battalion embarked at Belfast on the
10th of October, and arrived on the following day at
Irvine in North Britain.</p>

<p>General Girard’s division of the fifth French corps
having taken post at Caceres, Lieut.-General Rowland
Hill determined to drive the enemy from thence, and
on the approach of the British troops the French
retired, halting at <i>Arroyo-del-Molinos</i>.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October, the first battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched from Portalegre to Codesiera;
on the 23rd to Albuquerque; on the 24th to the Sierra
de San Pedro; on the 25th to Aliseda; on the 26th to
Malpartida; on the following day to Alcuesca, and
bivouacked without fires about a league from <i>Arroyo-del-Molinos</i>.
During the whole of this fatiguing march,
the weather was extremely severe, with constant rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The British troops, under Lieut.-General Hill,
marched about two o’clock in the morning of the 28th
of October, towards <i>Arroyo-del-Molinos</i>, a village
situated in a plain at the foot of a ridge of rocks rising
in the form of a crescent, their approach being concealed
by a thick mist with heavy rain. The French
infantry were assembling outside the village to commence
<ins class="corr" id="tn-54" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'there march to'">
their march to</ins> Merida, the baggage was being
loaded, and General Girard was waiting at his quarters
for his horse, when suddenly the <i>seventy-first</i> and <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiments charged into the village, capturing
much baggage and many prisoners; at the same time
the <i>twenty-eighth</i> and <i>thirty-fourth</i> regiments made a
detour, supported by the <i>thirty-ninth</i>, to cut off the
enemy’s retreat.</p>

<p>The French formed two squares and commenced retreating.
The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> attacked, and broke
one of the enemy’s squares, which was formed on the
other side of the village, and thereby completed his
overthrow.</p>

<p>In this brilliant affair the enemy lost all his artillery
and baggage; and several officers of rank and consideration,
with about fourteen hundred men, were taken
prisoners. General Brun and Colonel the Prince
d’Aremberg were among the prisoners. The ninth
and thirteenth light dragoons, and the second Hussars,
King’s German Legion, also shared in the action.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had Lieut.-Colonel John Cameron,
Captains Donald McDonald, John McPherson,
and Robert Nugent Dunbar (Brevet-Major), wounded;
three rank and file were killed and seven wounded.</p>

<p class="right fs80">
“Portalegre, 7th November, 1811.</p>

<p>“Lieut.-General Hill has great satisfaction in congratulating
the troops on the success which has
attended their recent operations in Estremadura, and
in so doing, he cannot but endeavour to do justice to
the merits of those through whose exertions it has
been obtained. A patient willing endurance of forced
and night marches, during the worst of weather and
over bad roads, of bivouacs in wet weather, oftentimes
without cover and without fire, and a strict
observance of discipline, are qualities, however common
in British soldiers, which the Lieut.-General
cannot pass unnoticed. Having on this occasion
witnessed the exertion of them in no ordinary degree,
he feels that nothing but the most zealous
attention of commanding officers, the good-will and
zealous spirit of the non-commissioned officers and
soldiers, could produce such an effect, and he requests
they will, generally and individually, accept
his warmest thanks, particularly those corps which
were engaged in the action of <i>Arroyo-del-Molinos</i>,
whose silent attention to orders, when preparing to
attack, and when manœuvring before the enemy,
could not but excite his notice, and give them an
additional claim on him.”</p>

<p>Letters from the Secretary of State, dated the 2nd,
and from His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief,
dated the 6th December, were promulgated, expressive
of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent’s
approbation and thanks to Lieut.-General Hill, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the troops under his command, for their brilliant
operations on the recent expedition in Spanish Estremadura,
in having totally surprised and defeated
the enemy under General Girard.</p>

<p>Viscount Wellington having made preparations for
the recapture of <i>Ciudad Rodrigo</i>, concentrated the main
body of the army in that neighbourhood, and the troops
under Lieut.-General Hill were therefore ordered to
divert the enemy’s attention in the south.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Hill marched from Portalegre on
the 26th of December, and proceeded on the 29th
to a bivouac about a league beyond La Nava, at which
village about three hundred French infantry were
discovered running to their arms upon the approach
of the head of the British cavalry column. They, however,
effected their escape to Merida, from which place
they had been that morning detached, and acquainted
General Dombrouski of the approach of the British
troops.</p>

<p>On the 30th of December, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> and
other British troops entered Merida, the French
having retreated during the night, where they halted
during the following day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1812, the British troops
moved upon Almendralejos, beyond which, and close
to the town, the enemy’s columns were formed, and
seen immediately retreating to Azauchal. On the 3rd,
Lieut.-General Hill matched his force to Villa Franca.
A brigade of infantry, and the cavalry, were pushed
forward to Fuentes del Maestre, where a smart affair
took place, the enemy retreating upon Llerena with
the loss of some prisoners.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Hill’s division returned to Almendralejos
on the 4th of January, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></span>
marched on the following day to Merida, where the
troops went into quarters. The siege of <i>Ciudad Rodrigo</i>,
which commenced on the 8th of January, being
in a state of forwardness, it was expected that the
French would make an effort to relieve the place.
Lieut.-General Hill was therefore directed to throw
a part of his force across the Tagus.</p>

<p>The troops accordingly marched on the 13th of
January from Merida to La Nava; on the 14th to
Zogalla; on the 15th to Albuquerque; on the 16th
to Codesiera; on the 17th to Portalegre; on the 19th
to Alpalhao; on the 20th to Niza; and on the following
day they crossed the Tagus at Villa Velha;
marched from thence to Sarnadas, and on the 22nd to
Castello Branco. During this march intelligence was
received of the storm and capture of <i>Ciudad Rodrigo</i>
by the British on the 19th of January.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of February, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> and
other regiments under Lieut.-General Hill, were
directed to return to Portalegre, where they arrived
on the 5th of that month.</p>

<p>The strength of the first battalion at this period
consisted of forty-three serjeants, sixteen drummers,
and seven hundred and thirty rank and file. On the
4th of March the battalion marched to Alegrete, and
on the following day to Albuquerque.</p>

<p>Previously to this time, a large quantity of artillery
stores and the battering train had been embarked at
Lisbon for the Mediterranean (as it was then reported),
but the vessels put into the Bay of Setuval; the whole
being landed at Alcacer de Sal, and conveyed up the
Alemtejo, soon appeared moving on the plains in front
and to the right of Elvas, in one long and continued
chain towards the Guadiana. The army now became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
aware that the third siege of <i>Badajoz</i> was to be undertaken.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Hill’s corps marched from Albuquerque
on the 15th of March, and arrived at La
Nava on the 16th;—proceeded on the following day to
Merida, where some officers and men of the enemy were
made prisoners. The division continued its march to
Almendralejos on the 18th of March, where the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
and other troops were stationed to cover the
siege of Badajoz, before which ground had been broken
on the previous day.</p>

<p>The division proceeded on the 21st of March from
Almendralejos to Merida, and on the 26th advanced
towards Medellin and Don Benito, from which places
it forced the enemy to retire. Advices were here
received, that the enemy, under Marshal Soult, was
advancing to Llerena, with a view to relieve Badajoz,
to the vicinity of which place the covering army was
directed to retire.</p>

<p>On the 31st of March, the division proceeded towards
Merida, where it arrived on the 2nd of April; it
marched on the 5th to a position near Talavera Real.
On the night of the 6th of April, Badajoz was assaulted
and carried by the troops under the Earl of Wellington,
Marshal Soult consequently retraced his steps towards
Seville.</p>

<p>The battalion marched into quarters in Almendralejos
on the 13th of April. A French force having
made an irruption into the province of Beira, the Earl
of Wellington, with the main body of the army, crossed
the Tagus immediately after the fall of Badajoz.</p>

<p>On the 12th of May, the battalion marched from
Almendralejos, and bivouacked near Merida; on the
13th near Arroyo-del-Molinos; on the 14th near Villa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Mesias; on the 15th entered Truxillo, and marched
again about midnight; on the 16th bivouacked near
Jaraicejo, and on the following day proceeded to the
mountains near Casas del Puerto.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched at
night to attack the enemy’s fortifications covering the
bridge of <i>Almaraz</i>. The ruggedness of the footpath
through the mountains, and the darkness of the night,
presented serious obstacles to a rapid march; it was
consequently daylight before the troops were formed
in the Valle de Canas.</p>

<p>The fiftieth regiment and a wing of the seventy-first
were formed in one column, and were destined to
assault Fort Napoleon on the 19th of May; while the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> under Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, and
the other wing of the seventy-first, were formed in a
second column, ready to support the attack on Fort
Napoleon, or to carry the <i lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i> at the same
moment, both columns being provided with scaling
ladders.</p>

<p>Fort Napoleon was carried in gallant style by the
column sent against it, the enemy flying from it
towards the <i lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i>; the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> dashed
forward and entered with him. The commandant of
Fort Ragusa, on the opposite bank of the Tagus, being
seized with a panic, had cut away the bridge of boats;
many of his countrymen consequently were either
drowned or made prisoners.</p>

<p>The attention of all was now directed to the passage
of the river. Some of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> immediately
leaped in, and swam to the opposite side, bringing the
boats back with them.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Thus was the bridge secured,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
together with Fort Ragusa, which the enemy immediately
abandoned.</p>

<p>The enemy attached great importance to his establishment
at this place, which secured the only direct
communication between his two armies, and its destruction
had the effect of placing them several days’ march
more distant from each other, and over mountainous
roads hardly passable by artillery. The works and
bridge at <i>Almaraz</i> having been destroyed, and about
five hundred prisoners secured, the troops returned to
Jaraicejo.</p>

<p>To commemorate the gallantry of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
in the above enterprise, the Royal Authority was
afterwards received for the word “<span class="smcap">Almaraz</span>” to be
borne on the Regimental Colour and Appointments.</p>

<p>On the 21st of May, the troops marched to Truxillo,
where they halted for two days. At this period intelligence
was received that the French had pressed
forward towards Almendralejos.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May, the corps under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill marched to a bivouac near Villa
Mesias; on the 25th proceeded to the vicinity of Rio
del Agua; on the 26th to near San Pedro, and occupied
quarters in Merida on the day following.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched from Merida on the
5th of June, and went into quarters in Almendralejos.
On the 12th of June it marched to Fuentes del
Maestre, and on the following day proceeded to Puebla
de Sancho Perez. The enemy having moved from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Andalusia in some force, evinced an inclination to bring
on an action in this advanced position, probably to
divert the Earl of Wellington from his operations upon
Salamanca, with which place Marshal Soult had no
direct communication since the loss of the bridge of
Almaraz, and every movement in advance threw him
farther from co-operating with Marshal Marmont.</p>

<p>The battalion retired to Los Santos on the 16th of
June; on the 17th to Santa Martha; and on the 18th
to a wood in front of Albuhera, where all the infantry
under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill were assembled;
some field-works were immediately thrown
up to strengthen the position, and enable the Earl of
Wellington, without apprehension for the safety of that
corps, to prosecute his attack upon the enemy’s forts
at <i>Salamanca</i>, which were captured on the 27th of June.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, the battalion advanced to Santa
Martha; on the 3rd it marched to a bivouac near
Villa Alva, where the enemy brought up some guns,
and cannonaded the troops; on the 4th it bivouacked
near Feria; on the 5th near Bienvenida; on the 6th
near Villa Garcia; and on the 7th it entered Llerena.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched from Llerena, by
Arlones, on the 8th of July to Berlenga, where some
cannonading and a cavalry skirmish took place, after
which the enemy retired, and the battalion returned on
the following day to Llerena.</p>

<p>The battalion again marched from Llerena on the
20th of July to Bienvenida, and on the following day
to Zafra. The enemy at this time moved to his right,
and had a force near Fuentes del Maestre.</p>

<p>During the night of the 26th of July, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
marched towards Villa Franca, near which
place the battalion bivouacked about daylight. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
French were about a league in front at Fuentes del
Maestre. Between nine and ten o’clock in the morning
of the 29th of July, a brigade of French guns was
drawn up on a height, in front of their position, and
fired a royal salute. Many were the surmises as to the
cause of this rejoicing, until some of the British officers
ascertained at the outposts, that the salute was in
honor of a victory supposed to have been gained by the
French at <i>Salamanca</i>.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, however, received
more authentic intelligence from the scene of action,
and immediately afterwards issued the following <span class="nowrap">order:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">
“<i>Villa Franca, 29th July, 1812.</i></p>

<p>“Captain Maxwell’s brigade of artillery will fire a
salute of twenty-one guns at twelve o’clock, being in
honor of the glorious and important victory gained
over the enemy at <i>Salamanca</i>, by the army under the
immediate command of the Earl of Wellington, on
the 22nd instant.</p>

<p>“An extra ration of wine or spirits is to be issued
to the British and Portuguese troops, to enable them
to drink the Earl of Wellington’s health.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr6">(Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “<span class="smcap">J. C. Rook</span>,</span><br>
“<i>Assistant Adjutant-General</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The troops were under arms, and after the salute,
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill advanced; the enemy,
however, did not await this proof that the victory was
on the side of the Allies, but immediately retired, and
Fuentes del Maestre was occupied by the British troops.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, the battalion went into
quarters in Villa Franca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>The allied army under the Marquis of Wellington,
which title was conferred upon him after the victory of
Salamanca, entered Madrid on the 12th of August, and
was received with every demonstration of joy by the
inhabitants. Marshal Soult, in consequence of this
movement, raised the blockade of Cadiz, and abandoning
Western Andalusia, moved towards Grenada.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s corps, of which
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> formed part, advanced on the 28th
of August to Usagre; on the 29th to Villa Garcia; on
the 30th proceeded to the left to Maquilla; on the
31st to El Campillo; on the 1st of September the
troops marched to Zalamea; on the 2nd to Quintana; on
the 3rd to La Nava; and on the 4th to quarters in
Don Benito.</p>

<p>On the 13th of September, Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill crossed the Guadiana, and marched to
Mojadas; on the 14th to Villa Mesias; and on the
15th to Truxillo, where the troops halted.</p>

<p>The troops resumed their march from Truxillo to a
bivouac near Jaraicejo on the 19th of September, and
on the day following crossed a pontoon bridge thrown
over the Tagus, where that of the enemy formerly
stood, and bivouacked near Almaraz; on the 21st the
division proceeded to Naval Moral; on the 22nd
marched to Calzada de Oropeza; on the 23rd to La
Gartera, and there halted.</p>

<p>On the 26th of September, Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill’s division marched to Talavera de la
Reinha; on the 27th to Cebolla; on the 28th to Torrijos;
on the 29th to Toledo; on the 30th to a bivouac
near Villa Mejor; and on the 1st of October to quarters
in Aranjuez.</p>

<p>At this period, the Marquis of Wellington was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
engaged in the siege of the Castle of Burgos. Information
was also received that Marshal Soult and
King Joseph, with their united armies, were advancing
from Valencia, and that their advanced guard was in
the neighbourhood of Ocanna, and moving on Madrid.</p>

<p>In consequence of the necessity of raising the siege
of the Castle of Burgos, and retreating, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>,
and other corps under Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill, moved from Aranjuez on the 23rd of
October, crossed the Tagus, and marched to
Colominarde Orejo; on the 25th advanced to the
bridge of Fuentes Duenna; on the 27th of October,
the enemy appeared on the opposite bank of the river
and reconnoitred. The troops under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill marched on the following day to
Villa Conejos, and on the same evening crossed the
Jarama at Puente Larga, and went into position; on
the 29th they marched to a bivouac near Valle de
Moro; on the 30th near Abavaca; and on the 31st to
El Escurial. The Marquis of Wellington, with the
main body of the army, was at this period returning
from the neighbourhood of Burgos towards Salamanca.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched to a bivouac near the
village of Guadarama on the 1st of November; on the
2nd crossed the Guadarama mountains, and bivouacked
at Villa Castine; on the 3rd at Blasco Sancho; on the
4th at Naveos Duenna; on the 5th at Canaracillo; on
the 7th crossed the river at <i>Alba de Tormes</i>, and
bivouacked. On the 8th of November, the battalion
was ordered into the town of Alba de Tormes to defend
it, the allied army being at this time concentrated
between that place and Salamanca.</p>

<p>The French, under Joseph Buonaparte, appeared on
the 10th of November in great force on the heights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
above, and close to <i>Alba de Tormes</i>; after reconnoitring
the place, the enemy commenced a very hot cannonade
from a numerous artillery; at the same time pushing
forward his light troops close under the old walls of the
town, his columns ready to advance at the first appearance
of the British being staggered by the effects of his
artillery and numerous sharpshooters.</p>

<p>No such opportunity occurred, and the enemy
withdrew his guns, after firing upwards of fifteen hundred
shot and shell in about three hours. Such was
the steadiness of the brigade, that he could not venture
on the assault of a place surrounded by an old Moorish
wall, in a state of perfect ruin, assailable at all points,
and without any other defence than the brave troops
that lined it. A strong force was kept watching the
motions of the allies, and the enemy’s light troops
kept up a skirmish during the 11th, 12th, and 13th of
November.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had eight rank and file killed;
Lieutenant Andrew Will and thirty-three rank and
file were wounded.</p>

<p>At daylight on the morning of the 14th of November,
the enemy’s cavalry were seen crossing the Tormes,
about a league above the town, which was evacuated
in the course of the day; the bridge blown up, and a
small Spanish garrison left in the castle. This night
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> bivouacked on the Arapiles, the
whole army being there in position.</p>

<p>On the 15th of November, the enemy appeared in
force about Mozarbes, and his numerous cavalry was
observed moving to its left, upon the British line of
communication with Ciudad Rodrigo. Towards evening
the allied troops were directed to retire from the right,
and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> bivouacked in a wood behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the Rio Valmuza; on the 16th near Matilla; and on
the 17th behind the Rio Cuebra. During these days,
the rear-guard was engaged in affairs with the enemy’s
cavalry and light artillery. On the 18th the battalion
bivouacked near Moraesverde; on the 19th marched
to Zamarra; on the 20th to Robledo, and halted.</p>

<p>The weather had been very severe during the last
few days, and the troops suffered much from its effects,
being obliged several times in each day to wade through
rivers, which had no existence at other seasons of the year.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched to San Payo on the
28th of November; on the following day to Perales;
and on the 30th to Casas de Don Gomez. On the 1st
of December it went into winter quarters in Coria,
where a detachment of two serjeants and thirty-six
rank and file joined from the second battalion, which
was at this period stationed in Scotland.</p>

<p>The strength of the first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment now consisted of thirty-seven serjeants,
fourteen drummers, and six hundred and forty-five
rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>On the 17th of January, 1813, the battalion marched
from Coria to Montehermosa, and on the 13th of
February it marched to Guejo, thence to Aldea Nueva,
and on the 15th to Puerta de Bannos. This movement
took place in consequence of the advance of a French
force from Salamanca towards Bejar, into which place
some troops were thrown, and the enemy, then close to
the town, retired. He, however, returned with an
increased force shortly afterwards, and in the night
attempted to surprise the garrison of Bejar, consisting
of the <i>fiftieth regiment</i>, and the <i>sixth Portugese
Caçadores</i>, by which he was repulsed with loss. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment was put
in motion to their support, and the same evening returned
to its quarters in Bannos.</p>

<p>While stationed at Bannos in April, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
received a draft of forty-six men from the second
battalion. The effective strength at this period consisted
of forty-four serjeants, fifteen drummers, and
eight hundred and seventeen rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 20th of May, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched
from Bannos to Bejar; on the 21st to Valle de
Fuentes; on the 24th to Fuenteroble; on the 25th to
Calzadilla; and on the following day crossed the Tormes,
above Salamanca, from which place the enemy retired
with the loss of some men and artillery. On the 27th
of May, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, and other corps under
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, passed the Marquis
of Wellington in review-order, and marched to Orvado,
where they halted.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched on the 3rd of June
from the camp at Orvado, crossed the Guarena, and
encamped near Villa Buena; on the 4th the battalion
crossed the Douro at Toro, and marched to Morales;
on the 5th to Villa Sexmil; on the 6th to Mucientes,
leaving Valladolid to the right; on the 7th to Duenas;
on the 8th to Torre Quemada; on the 9th to Quintana
del Ponte; on the 10th crossed the Pisuerga, and
marched to Pedroza; on the 11th to Valbases; on the
12th to Celada del Camino; and on the 13th to Villa
Ricos, on which morning, about daylight, the enemy
blew up the Castle of Burgos, and retreated.</p>

<p>On the 14th of June, the battalion marched to
Villa Toro; on the 15th to Villa Esquiar; on the
16th it crossed the Ebro, and marched to Pesquez;
on the 17th it marched to Villa Mor; on the 18th to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Boveano; on the 19th to Alcoide; and on the 20th
to Robeo.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the French army, commanded by
King Joseph, had taken up a position in the neighbourhood
of <i>Vittoria</i>, where the Marquis of Wellington determined
to attack the enemy.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the 21st of June, the first battalion
of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, quitted its encampment early
in the morning, and moved to La Puebla, where it
crossed the river Zadorra, and ascended the mountain
behind the village, which the Spaniards named “<i lang="es">Alturas
de los Inglezes</i>,” from an action fought there by the
English in 1367, when Edward the Black Prince proceeded
to Spain to assist Peter, King of Castile, to recover
his throne.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The memorable battle of <i>Vittoria</i> commenced by
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill obtaining possession
of the heights of <i>La Puebla</i>, on which the enemy’s left
rested. The enemy immediately sent a reinforcement
of about seven thousand men, with some artillery to
this point, and made several attempts to recover his
lost ground, but was as frequently repulsed by the
troops which were opposed to him; and by that means
they covered the remainder of the second division,
while filing across the Zadorra, and in its movement to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
attack the enemy in the village of <i>Subijana de Alava</i>.
Each corps kept its ground with coolness and steadiness,
until everything was prepared on the left, and the
allied army advanced across the plain.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was again
directed to advance, and drive the enemy from every
post in its front, which duty it performed in its usual
manner, and the French having given way at all points,
the battalion continued a rapid pursuit along the
Pampeluna road, until about midnight, when it was
halted near Ganuz.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the French suffered a great loss
of men, together with all their artillery, baggage, and
stores. King Joseph, whose carriage and court-equipage
being seized, had barely time to escape on horseback.
The defeat was the most complete that the
French had experienced in Spain.</p>

<p>The bâton of Marshal Jourdan was taken by the
eighty-seventh regiment, and the Prince Regent, in
the name and behalf of His Majesty, appointed the
Marquis of Wellington a Field Marshal. In a most
flattering letter, the Prince thus conferred the honor:
“You have sent me among the trophies of your unrivalled
fame, the staff of a French Marshal, and I
send you in return that of England.”</p>

<p>In commemoration of the share the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
bore in gaining this signal victory, the royal authority
was afterwards received for the word “<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>,” to
be inscribed on the regimental colour and appointments.
A medal was also conferred on the commanding
officer, Lieut.-Colonel John Cameron.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had four rank and file killed,
and sixteen wounded.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of June, the allies followed the retreating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
enemy, on which day the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
marched to about a league in front of Salvatierra, and
encamped; on the 23rd proceeded to near Arbeniz; on
the 24th to near Araquil; on the 25th to near Stormende;
on the 26th to near Zuaza; and on the 27th
marched to Orcayen, about three miles from <i>Pampeluna</i>,
which latter place was afterwards invested.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched to a wood near Lizasso
on the 2nd of July; on the 3rd to Puerta Velate; on
the 4th to <i>Almandoz</i>, where a skirmish took place, the
enemy being in position between Beruete and Aniz.
On the 5th, after some movements to turn the left of
his position, he retreated, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
bivouacked in front of Elizondo, halting there during
the following day.</p>

<p>On the 7th of July, the enemy was seen in a strong
position on the heights of <i>Maya</i>, and troops were sent
across the Bidassoa to attack his right. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
marched through the village of Maya in the
afternoon, and a good deal of fighting took place during
the day, the light troops continuing to skirmish until
dark, when the battalion bivouacked.</p>

<p>Advancing early in the morning of the 8th of July,
the French retired from their <em>own</em> frontier, which the
pursuing troops occupied with three British cheers. The
light troops continued the pursuit towards the village
of Urdax.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, the troops marched to the village
of Maya. The siege of <i>St. Sebastian</i> was undertaken,
and the garrison of <i>Pampeluna</i> was closely invested by
the Spaniards at this period.</p>

<p>Upon Napoleon receiving the news of the defeat of
the French at Vittoria, he immediately sent Marshal
Soult to Spain, with the rank of “Lieutenant of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Emperor,” and the Marshal assumed the command of
the army of Spain on the 12th of July. All his
energies were directed to retrieve its disasters, and to
drive the British across the Ebro.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July, the first brigade, at this period
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, marched to occupy the heights of
<i>Maya</i>.</p>

<p>The effective strength of the battalion, under the
command of Major James Mitchell, consisted of forty
serjeants, fifteen drummers, and seven hundred and
sixty-two rank and file, on the 25th of July, on which
day the fiftieth regiment was stationed on the right of
the brigade, to the left of a pass leading to the village
of Maya, which was occupied by a piquet from the
second brigade.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> were stationed in the Maya
Pass, to the right of the road leading from Urdax,
and the seventy-first regiment still further to the left.
The enemy collected a force of about fifteen thousand
men behind some rocky ground in front of the British
right, and with this overwhelming force drove in the
light companies of the second brigade, gaining the
high rock on the right of the allied position before the
arrival of the second brigade from Maya, which was,
therefore, compelled to retrace its steps towards the
village, instead of falling back to its left on the first
brigade.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, detached the fiftieth to the
right the moment the action commenced. That regiment
was severely engaged, and was forced to retire
along the ridge; the right wing of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>,
under Major John McPherson, was sent to its support,
and for some time had to stand the whole brunt of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
enemy’s column. The right wing of the seventy-first
regiment was also brought up, but such was the
advantage of the position the enemy had gained by
separating the two brigades, and in a manner descending
upon the Pass of Maya, while a fresh division was
pushing up to it from the direction of Urdax, that
the small body of troops received orders to retire to a
high rock on the left of the position.</p>

<p>This movement was covered by the left wings of the
seventy-first and <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiments, which,
relieving each other with the utmost order and regularity,
and disputing every inch of ground, left nothing
for the enemy to boast of. The brigade continued to
hold the rock until the arrival of Major-General
Edward Barnes’s brigade, when a general charge was
made, and every inch of ground recovered as far as
the Maya Pass.</p>

<p>On this occasion the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was ordered by
Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir William Stewart
not to charge, the battalion having been hotly engaged
for ten successive hours, and in want of ammunition.
The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, however, for the first time disregarded
an order, and not only charged, but led the charge.</p>

<p>During the whole of the action on the 25th of July,
the conduct of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was most noble and
devoted; and in commemoration of which His Majesty
was pleased to permit Lieut.-Colonel Cameron to bear
on his shield the word “<span class="smcap">Maya</span>.” Lieut.-Colonel
John Cameron and Major James Mitchell were both
wounded at the head of the battalion, and the command
devolved on Major John McPherson, who
was also wounded, but did not leave the field. The
other officers wounded were Captains George W.
Holmes, Ronald McDonald, and Samuel Bevan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Lieutenants William Fyfe, Donald McPherson, John
A. Durie, James John Chisholm, Robert Winchester,
Donald McDonald, James Ker Ross, George Gordon,
John Grant, and Alexander McDonald, (died) and
Ensigns Thomas Mitchell and George Mitchell.</p>

<p>Ensign Ewen Kennedy was killed. The other
casualties were thirty-four rank and file killed, and two
hundred and sixty eight rank and file wounded; and
twenty-two rank and file missing.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir William Napier, in his History of
the Peninsular War, in narrating the action in the Pass
of Maya, has alluded to the loss of the battalion, and
its gallantry, in the following <span class="nowrap">terms:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And that officer (Lieut.-Colonel Cameron) still
holding the Pass of Maya with the left wings of the
seventy-first and <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiments, brought
their right wings and the Portuguese guns into action,
and thus maintained the fight; but so dreadful was
the slaughter, especially of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, that
it is said the advancing enemy was actually stopped
by the heaped mass of dead and dying.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“The stern valour of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> would have
graced Thermopylæ.”</p>

<hr class="tb">
</div>

<p>The enemy having turned the British position at
Roncesvalles, the troops were withdrawn. The first
battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was ordered to march
from Puerto de Maya, and arrived in position at
Iruite early in the morning of the 26th of July.</p>

<p>The troops composing the right of the allied army
at Roncesvalles, having retired towards Pampeluna,
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched, on the 27th of July, from
its position near Iruite, and halted between Puerta
Velate and Lanz. On the following day, the battalion
marched to a bivouac near Lizasso, and, on the 29th,
marched somewhat further towards Pampeluna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>On the 30th of July, the battalion advanced to a
position between the village of <i>Lizasso</i> and <i>Eguaros</i>,
when the enemy appeared at the former place, and
commenced an extended movement upon the British
left. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, under the command of
Major John McPherson, was directed against him,
and found itself opposed to a column of about two
thousand men, which the battalion immediately
charged, and drove from the ridge in a most gallant
style. After this the French moved still further to
their right, and accordingly the left of the allies was
thrown back in the direction of Arestegui. The action
ceased about dark.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had Captain George W. Holmes
wounded. Nine rank and file were killed, and twenty-six
wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> advanced, and on the 31st of
July, came up with the enemy strongly posted on a
hill at <i>Dona Maria</i>, which could only be approached
by a narrow ziz-zag road through very close underwood.
In this favorable position the enemy made
great resistance, but was ultimately driven from the
heights, and his defeat was particularly ascribed to
the persevering bravery individually displayed in the
ranks of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, under whose eye
the battalion was this day engaged, bestowed the most
flattering encomiums on its gallantry. On this occasion
Major McPherson was wounded, and Captain
James Seaton assumed the command. Captains James
Lee and Dugald Campbell, Lieutenant James Hope,
and Ensign Thomas Mitchell, were also wounded. Ten
rank and file were killed, and sixty-nine wounded.</p>

<p>After carrying this post, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> moved
towards Lanz, and, on the 1st of August, marched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
through the pass at Lanz to Ariscun, and on the 2nd,
again occupied the heights of Maya.</p>

<p>The royal authority was subsequently granted for
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>” on
the regimental colour and appointments, to commemorate
the services of the first battalion in these combats,
which have been designated the “<em>Battles of the Pyrenees</em>.”
Medals, bearing the word “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>,” were
conferred on Major John McPherson and Captain
James Seaton; and the former was promoted to the
brevet rank of Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p>The effective strength of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was
now reduced to twenty-seven serjeants, fifteen drummers,
and three hundred and twenty rank and file.
The battalion marched on the evening of the 2nd of
August to the village of Erassu, and on the 5th reoccupied
the heights of Maya.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched
from Maya to the valley of Alduides, and the next day
to Roncesvalles, between which place and the heights
of Don Carlos, the battalion remained encamped until
the beginning of November.</p>

<p>In the meantime, <i>St. Sebastian</i> and <i>Pampeluna</i> had
been captured, and the British commander, looking
down from the lofty Pyrenees on the well-guarded
territory of France, resolved to carry the war into the
heart of that country.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November, the enemy made an
attempt to cut off a piquet of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, but
was foiled. On the following day, the battalion
marched from Roncesvalles to Alduides, and on the
9th proceeded through Maya to Urdax, in which
neighbourhood the whole division was assembled.</p>

<p>The British army was put in motion at an early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
hour in the morning of the 10th of November, and
advanced to attack the enemy in his fortified position
on the <i>Nivelle</i>. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, forded that river a
little below Ainhoe, and was ordered to attack the
strong redoubts on the heights immediately in rear of
the village.</p>

<p>The action became very warm towards the centre of
the British line, and the sixth division, with the Portuguese
division immediately on the left, having turned
the redoubts to the right of the enemy’s position on
the heights of Ainhoe, the French in front of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> made little resistance, running out of
the redoubts in the utmost confusion; the enemy
giving way at all points, left the allies a complete
victory, and abandoned all his artillery and stores.
The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> occupied the huts in the French
position for the night, and the next day advanced to
Espelette.</p>

<p>On the 12th of November, the division moved in
advance to reconnoitre the enemy at Cambo, and after
driving in his outposts and effecting the object in view,
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> bivouacked at a short distance from
the town.</p>

<p>The battalion went into quarters in Cambo on the
16th of November; the enemy having previously
blown up the bridge, retired across the <i>Nive</i>, leaving
some pieces of heavy artillery behind.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November, a detachment of one hundred
men joined from the second battalion, which still
remained in Scotland.</p>

<p>The rivers, which had been greatly swollen by the
rains, having partly subsided, the allied army was
put in motion across the <i>Nive</i> on the 9th of December.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Cameron, forded that river near Cambo, but did not
meet with much opposition, as the enemy retired to
prevent his retreat to Bayonne from being cut off by
the sixth division, which was crossing lower down the
river. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> advanced on the same day
to Urcuray: on the 10th and 11th, the French attacked
the troops on the left of the Nive, but on each day
were repulsed.</p>

<p>On the 11th of December, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
advanced to Petite Moguerre, a small village near
Bayonne, situated between the rivers Nive and Adour.</p>

<p>The enemy was observed at daylight in the morning
of the 13th of December, formed in very heavy columns
between his entrenched camp at Bayonne, and the village
of St. Pierre, on the road leading to St. Jean-Pied-de-Port.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Cameron, was ordered to advance to the centre
of the position at <i>St. Pierre</i>, against which the enemy
appeared to direct his principal attack. The battalion
had scarcely arrived on its ground, when it was led
into action, and by a most opportune and determined
charge, drove the French from the British position
(of which they had for a moment possessed themselves)
to the very point from whence they had started.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was recalled to its proper position,
and no sooner was it formed there, than the enemy
again attacked, and was again repulsed. Besides
being exposed during this day to a continued fire of
musketry and artillery, the battalion made <em>four</em> distinct
charges with the bayonet, each time driving the enemy
to his original position in front of his entrenchments.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir William Stewart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
K.B., in his report of the action, stated, that “several
brilliant charges were made by our troops in the
centre, against which the enemy’s principal attack
was directed, more particularly that by the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
Highlanders.”</p>

<p>In speaking of the defeat of the enemy’s principal
attack on the road to St. Jean Pied-de-Port, where the
first brigade was stationed, the Marquis of Wellington
said in his despatch, “they were particularly engaged
in the contest with the enemy at that point, and these
troops conducted themselves admirably.”</p>

<p>On this occasion Lieutenants Duncan McPherson,
Thomas Mitchell, and Alan McDonald were killed.
Major John McPherson (mortally), Captains George
W. Holmes, Ronald McDonald, and Donald McPherson;
Lieutenants John Catenaugh, Ronald McDonald,
James John Chisholm, Robert Winchester, and George
Mitchell, and Ensign William Fraser were wounded.
Twenty-eight rank and file were killed, and one hundred
and forty-three wounded.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this action, an honorary badge
was conferred by His Majesty on Lieut.-Colonel
Cameron, bearing the word “<span class="smcap">Nive</span>,” and the senior
captain of the regiment (Captain James Seaton) was
promoted to the brevet rank of major. The royal
authority was also granted for the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> to
bear the word “<span class="smcap">Nive</span>” on the regimental colour and
appointments.</p>

<p>The enemy retired into Bayonne a little before dark,
and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> went into its former quarters
in Petite Moguerre.</p>

<p>On the 14th of December, the following order was
issued by Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir William
<span class="nowrap">Stewart, K.B.:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p class="right fs80">
“Head Quarters, near Petite Moguerre,<br>
<span class="padr4">“14th December, 1813.</span></p>

<p>“The second division has greatly distinguished
themselves, and its gallantry in yesterday’s action is
avowed by the Commander of the forces and the
allied army.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched from Petite Moguerre
on the 17th of December, and on the 19th occupied
cantonments in Arquite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>On the 4th of January, 1814, the battalion marched
from Arquite, and encamped near Urt; on the 8th it
went into cantonments in that village. On the 20th
of January the battalion marched from Urt for St.
Jean de Luz, where it received new clothing, and on
the 20th returned to Urt.</p>

<p>The enemy attacked on the 27th of January a piquet
of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, stationed in an island on the
Adour, but was driven back.</p>

<p>At this period the allied army was put in motion,
and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched from Urt to Urcuray.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Cameron, marched on the 14th of February
to attack a considerable body of the enemy under
General Harispe at <i>Hellette</i>, which was forced to retire
to Meharin. On this occasion Lieutenant Richard
McDonell was wounded; one private was killed, and
seven rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th of February, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
marched in pursuit of the enemy, who was
discovered, late in the evening, strongly posted on the
heights in front of <i>Garris</i>, which the division attacked
and carried in gallant style. The French obstinately
disputed their ground, and made several attempts to
recover it after dark, but finding the British troops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
immovable, they retreated with considerable loss
through St. Palais. On this occasion Major James
Seaton was mortally wounded, and expired on the
22nd of the following month. The other casualties
were three rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>During the night the enemy destroyed the bridge
at St. Palais, and every exertion was made to repair
it. On the 16th of February, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
crossed in the afternoon, and occupied a position in
advance.</p>

<p>On the 17th of February, the enemy was discovered
in the village of <i>Arriverete</i>, on the right bank of the
Gave de Mauleon, endeavouring to destroy the bridge
over it. A ford was discovered a little higher up,
which the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> crossed under cover of the
British artillery, and immediately attacking the troops
in the village with its usual success, drove the enemy
out of it, and secured the bridge by which the troops
were enabled to cross. The enemy retired across the
Gave d’Oleron, and the battalion, which had ten rank
and file wounded in this enterprise, was cantoned in
Arriverete and the neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>In honor of this occasion, it was granted by royal
warrant, that Lieut.-Colonel Cameron should bear for
his crest a Highlander of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment,
up to the middle in water, grasping in his right hand
a broad sword, and in his left a banner inscribed 92nd,
within a wreath of laurel; and as a motto over it the
word “<i>Arriverete</i>.”</p>

<p>The following is an extract of the Marquis of Wellington’s
despatch on this <span class="nowrap">occasion:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">
“St. Jean de Luz, 20th February, 1814.</p>

<p>“The enemy retired across the river at St. Palais in
the night, destroying the bridges, which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
were repaired so that the troops under Sir Rowland
Hill crossed on the 16th, and on the 17th the enemy
were driven across the Gave de Mauleon.</p>

<p>“They attempted to destroy the bridge at Arriverete,
but they had not time to complete its destruction;
and a ford being discovered above the
bridge, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, supported by the
fire of Captain Beane’s troop of horse artillery,
crossed the ford, and made a most gallant attack
upon two battalions of French infantry posted in the
village, from which the latter were driven with considerable
loss.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Marquis of Wellington addressed the following
letter to Lieut.-General Lord Niddry (afterwards Earl
of Hopetoun), colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, relative
to an application to be permitted to bear the word
“<span class="smcap">Arriverete</span>” on the regimental colour and <span class="nowrap">appointments:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">
“Cambray, 13th April, 1816.</p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</div>

<p>“I have received your letter of the
2nd, regarding the desire of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment
to bear the word “<em>Arriverete</em>” on their colour,
&amp;c., to which I have no objection, and I will apply
for the distinction, if after this explanation they
should still desire it.</p>

<p>“Arriverete is a village on the Gave de Mauleon,
at which there is a wooden bridge. We had passed
the river at other points, but our communication
across it was difficult, and the enemy was of such a
force at Sauveterre, in the neighbourhood, that we
could not venture to move along it, and I wished to
get possession of the bridge before the enemy could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
destroy it. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> forded the river,
and attacked and took the village, against a very
superior force of the enemy, in the most gallant style,
(in the manner in which they have always performed
every service in which they have been employed),
but without much loss; there the affair ended; we
were not prepared at that time to do more, and we
held that village as a <i lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i> till our means were
in readiness for our further operations.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt but the troops behaved as gallantly
in this affair as they could in any of greater
importance, but the result was not of that consequence
to the ulterior operations of the army, to have rendered
it notorious to the army at large; and although
I reported it as I ought, I know there are many
belonging to the army, some even who were present,
have no recollection of the name of the place which
was the scene of the action, and some not even of
the action itself.</p>

<p>“It appears to me to be beneath the reputation of
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> to have to explain for what cause
the name of a particular place has been inserted in
their colours; and notwithstanding that on no occasion
could they or any other troops behave better
than they did upon that, I acknowledge that I am
anxious they should not press the request. But
if after this explanation they continue to wish it,
I will take care it shall be granted.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched in the morning of the
24th of February, 1814, and crossed the Gave d’Oleron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
by a ford near Villeneuve, and on the 25th moved on
the road towards <i>Orthes</i>, and encamped near Laas,
where the battalion halted. The allied army was at
this period crossing the Gave de Pau, near Peyrehorade,
with the exception of the corps under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, the army under the Marquis
of Wellington, on the right bank of the Gave de
Pau advanced to attack the French position near
<i>Orthes</i>, and the action soon became general. The
first brigade, to which the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> under
Lieut.-Colonel Cameron belonged, was directed to a
ford above the town of Orthes, and had the honor of
leading the second division across the Gave de Pau,
under a very heavy fire of musketry and artillery, and
possessing itself of the road from Orthes to the town
of Pau, immediately in rear of the enemy’s left flank,
his retreat on that line was consequently cut off. The
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> was ordered to move upon the road to
St. Sever, along the rear of the enemy, whose retreat,
which had been conducted hitherto with some degree
of order, now became a perfectly confused flight. The
pursuit was at an equally rapid pace, in which the
battalion was conspicuous for several miles, until it
halted at Sault de Navailles.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this victory, which cost the
enemy twelve pieces of cannon, and about seven thousand
men, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> received the royal authority
to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments. His Majesty was also pleased
to confer honorary badges, bearing the word “<em>Orthes</em>,”
on Lieut.-Colonel John Cameron, who commanded the
first battalion, and on Major James Mitchell, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
commanded the light companies; the latter officer
was promoted to the brevet rank of lieut.-colonel.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> had only three rank and file
wounded, and one killed, in the battle of Orthes.</p>

<p>On the 28th of February, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched
to St. Medard, and on the 1st of March proceeded to
Grenade; the main body of the allied army had at
this period crossed the Adour at St. Sever.</p>

<p>The enemy, on the 2nd of March, was seen strongly
posted on a ridge in front of the town of <i>Aire</i>, with his
right resting on the Adour. The allied army advanced
to the attack, and compelled him to retire; but a brigade
of Portuguese troops on the British flank giving way,
the French became encouraged, and in their turn advanced.
The <i>fiftieth</i> and <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiments,
after clearing their own front, were moved rapidly to
the point where the enemy was successful, and by a
most splendid charge immediately put him to flight.</p>

<p>These regiments now became considerably separated
from each other, from having to occupy the ground destined
for the Portuguese troops, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
was again opposed to a strong column on its flank, which
it immediately charged, and pursued through the town
of Aire, in which the battalion was afterwards cantoned.</p>

<p>Captain William Fyfe, Lieutenants John A. Durie
and Richard McDonell were wounded. The other
casualties of the battalion were three rank and file
killed, and twenty-nine wounded.</p>

<p>His Majesty, in honor of this occasion, granted permission
for Lieut.-Colonel Cameron to bear upon his
shield a view of the town, with the word “<span class="smcap">Aire</span>.”</p>

<p>The following Division and General Orders were
issued, alluding to the action of this <span class="nowrap">day:—</span></p>

<p>On the 10th of March, a letter and address, of which

</div>

<p>Information having been received that the enemy
was making a movement to his left, and attempting to
throw himself upon the right flank of the British, a
corresponding move was made by the Marquis of
Wellington, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched from
Aire on the 13th of March, by the road to Pau, and
halted in a position near Garlin, the French being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
posted behind the river Gros Lees. On the 18th, the
battalion marched to Conchez, the enemy retiring towards
Lembege on the approach of the allies.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> moved upon Lembege on the
19th of March, where a skirmish took place, the enemy
falling back to Vic Bigorre; here he seemed determined
to make a stand, but the third division, which
moved by a road to the British left, drove him in excellent
style from his position, and he retired across the
Adour. The battalion halted for the night in front of
Vic Bigorre.</p>

<p>On the 20th of March, the left of the army crossed
the Adour, and moved upon the enemy’s right near
Rabastens, while the right marched upon Tarbes, the
French having retired from it, as the allied columns
were forming for their attack.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> continued in pursuit of the
enemy on the main road from Tarbes to Toulouse, by
St. Gaudens, Mariemont, and St. Julien, and halted
on the 26th of March at Muret: there had been constant
rain for several days previous, which impeded operations;
on the 27th, the troops under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill were withdrawn to St. Roque.</p>

<p>On the 31st of March, 1814, the division crossed the
Garonne by a pontoon bridge, and proceeded to Miremont;
on the 1st of April to Cintegabelle, and crossed
the Arriege. No road for artillery could be discovered
from this place to Toulouse, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
recrossed the Garonne at St. Roque, the pontoons being
removed towards Grenade.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched on the 5th of April to
cantonments at St. Simon. At this period the river
Garonne had swollen, and this circumstance made it
necessary to remove the pontoons by which part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
allied army had crossed; they were however replaced,
and on the evening of the 9th of April the main body
of the British army was on the right of the Garonne.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> advanced
by the Muret road to the vicinity of <i>Toulouse</i>, and drove
Marshal Soult’s outposts into his entrenchments on
that side. The services of the battalion were not again
required during this day; it however witnessed the
gallant conduct of its comrades on the opposite bank
of the river, driving the enemy from his redoubts above
the town, and gaining a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the 11th of April nothing particular occurred
beyond a skirmish, and confining the enemy to the
suburbs. The French evacuated Toulouse during the
night, and the white flag was hoisted. On the 12th
of April the Marquis of Wellington entered the city
amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants. The
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> followed the enemy on the Villa
Franche road, and encamped in advance of that town.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon of the 12th of April,
intelligence was received of the abdication of Napoleon:
had not the express been delayed on the journey by
the French police, the sacrifice of many valuable lives
would have been prevented.</p>

<p>A disbelief in the truth of this intelligence occasioned
much unnecessary bloodshed at <i>Bayonne</i>, the garrison
of which made a desperate sortie on the 14th of April,
and Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards Earl
of Hopetoun), the Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment,
was taken prisoner. Major-General Andrew
Hay was killed, and Major-General Stopford was
wounded. This was the last action of the Peninsular
war.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April, 1814, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></span>
marched into Villa Franche; on the 24th to Beziege;
and on the 25th occupied quarters in Toulouse.</p>

<p>A treaty of peace was established between Great
Britain and France; Louis XVIII. was restored to the
throne of France, and Napoleon Buonaparte was permitted
to reside at Elba, the sovereignty of that island
having been conferred upon him by the allied powers.</p>

<p>The war being ended, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched
from Toulouse on the 5th of June, and continued on
the move until the 19th of that month, when it
encamped at Blanchfort, about two leagues from
Bourdeaux.</p>

<p>In addition to the other distinctions acquired during
the war in Spain, Portugal, and the south of France
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> received the royal authority to bear,
the word “<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>” on the Regimental Colour and
Appointments.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> marched from
Blanchfort, and encamped near Pouillac. On the 17th
of July, the battalion was conveyed down the Garonne
in small craft, and embarked in H. M.’s ship “Norge,”
which sailed immediately, and on the 26th entered
Cove of Cork harbour.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> disembarked at Monkstown on
the 29th of July, and marched to Fermoy barracks,
where the thanks of Parliament were communicated to
the officers and soldiers for “the meritorious and
eminent services which they had rendered to their
King and Country during the course of the war.”</p>

<p>On the 6th of August, the first battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, commanded by Colonel
Cameron, was inspected at Fermoy by Major-General
Sir William Aylett, who expressed in orders his great
satisfaction at its appearance under arms, as well as of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
its interior economy. Its effective strength consisted
of fifty serjeants, sixteen drummers, and seven hundred
rank and file.</p>

<p>Two captains and three lieutenants were ordered on
the 12th of October to proceed to Scotland to take
under their charge the non-commissioned officers and
men of the second battalion, about to be transferred to
the first battalion.</p>

<p>On the 24th of October, the second battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment was disbanded at Edinburgh,
and twelve serjeants, thirteen drummers, and one
hundred and sixty-one rank and file were transferred
to the first battalion, which they joined at Fermoy in
January following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment marched on the 27th
of January, 1815, from Fermoy to Cork barracks,
where an authority was received for the establishment to
be one thousand rank and file.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment was not destined to
remain long on home service. The peace of Europe
was again disturbed. Napoleon Bonaparte returned
from Elba, landed at Cannes, in Provence, on the 1st
of March, 1815, with a handful of men, and on the
20th of that month entered Paris at the head of an
army which had joined him on the road. Louis XVIII.
withdrew from Paris to Ghent, and Napoleon assumed
his former dignity of Emperor of the French; but the
allied Powers refused to acknowledge his sovereignty,
and determined on his dethronement. Preparations
for war commenced accordingly, and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment was ordered to proceed on foreign service.</p>

<p>The regiment marched to the Cove of Cork on the
1st of May, and embarked in transports, which sailed
on the 3rd of May. Its effective strength consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
forty-seven serjeants, sixteen drummers, and six hundred
and twenty-one rank and file. The regiment
anchored near Ostend on the 9th of May, was removed
in boats on the following day, and subsequently proceeded
by the canal to Bruges.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May the regiment proceeded to
Ghent, where it landed, and was quartered. Louis
XVIII. was residing there at this period.</p>

<p>The regiment marched from Ghent to Alost on the
27th of May, and on the 28th to Brussels, where it
was placed in Major-General Sir Denis Pack’s brigade,
with the third battalion of the Royals, the forty-second
Highlanders, and the second battalion of the
forty-fourth regiment.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June the British brigades of the fifth
division, to which the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> belonged, were
reviewed by Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington,
who expressed his entire approbation of their appearance,
and his happiness at again seeing those that
had served with such reputation in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Napoleon left Paris on the 12th of June, and conformably
to his usual plan of directing at once his
whole force against some important point, he determined
to attack the British and Prussian armies before the
arrival of the Austrians and Russians, who were already
in movement towards the frontiers. On the 15th,
intelligence having been received that the French had
entered the Netherlands, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> lay upon
their arms during the night.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, the division under Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Picton marched at daylight, and
about two o’clock came within range of the enemy’s
artillery in front of Genappe, at some farm-houses
denominated <i lang="fr">Les Quatre Bras</i>, where the main road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
from Charleroi to Brussels is crossed by another from
Nivelles to Namur, and which served as the British
communication with the Prussians on the left.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment was ordered to line a
ditch in the front of this latter road, to the left of the
farm-houses, and the Duke of Wellington took his
station with it. The enemy poured a very hot fire of
artillery on this post, and his cavalry charged it, but
was received by a well-directed volley from the regiment,
and forced to retire with great loss of men and horses.
His cannonade still continued, and his cavalry again
charged, and were repulsed as before. In the meantime
the French infantry had been forming under cover
of their cavalry attacks, assisted by their artillery, and
now advanced upon the regiment, when the Duke of
Wellington said, “<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, you must charge
these fellows!” These words were scarcely uttered,
when every man of the regiment sprang over the ditch,
and his orders were fully and literally obeyed. The
enemy was not only driven from the houses and gardens
about Quatre Bras, but chased for half a mile beyond
it, until the regiment was recalled about nightfall, and
the action ceased.</p>

<p>On this occasion the regiment had to lament the loss
of its commanding officer, Colonel Cameron,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> an
officer who had led the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> in many a
sanguinary field. He fell as he had lived, with honor;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and the Duke of Wellington thus expressed himself in
his despatch to Earl Bathurst of the 29th of June,
transmitting lists of the killed and <span class="nowrap">wounded:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your Lordship will see in the enclosed lists the
names of some most valuable officers lost to His
Majesty’s service. Among them I cannot avoid to
mention Colonel Cameron, of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>,
and Colonel Sir Henry Ellis, of the twenty-third
regiments, to whose conduct I have frequently drawn
your Lordship’s attention, and who at last fell distinguishing
themselves at the head of the brave troops
which they commanded.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the glory of the occasion, it is
impossible not to lament such men, both on account
of the public, and as friends.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Duke of Wellington particularly mentioned
the twenty-eighth, forty-second, seventy-ninth, and
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiments in his account of the action at
Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment during the action was
successively commanded by Colonel Cameron, Lieut.-Colonel
James Mitchell, and Major Donald Macdonald.
Colonel Cameron, Captain William Little, Lieutenant
James John Chisholm, Ensigns Abel Becher, and John
Ross McPherson were killed. Lieut.-Colonel James
Mitchell, Captains George W. Holmes, Dugald Campbell,
and William Charles Grant; Lieutenants Robert
Winchester, Thomas Hobbs, Thomas McIntosh, James
Ker Ross, Ronald McDonald, Hector Munro Innes,
George Logan, John McKinlay, George Mackie,
Alexander McPherson, Ewen Ross, Ensigns John
Branwell, Robert Logan, Angus McDonald, Robert
Hewitt, and assistant-surgeon John Stewart were
wounded. Thirty-five rank and file were killed, and
two hundred and forty-five were wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>The following is a copy of Major McDonald’s report
of the action, written on the spot, to Major-General Sir
Denis <span class="nowrap">Pack, K.C.B.—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</div>

<p><span class="pad2">“Colonel Cameron</span> and Lieut.-Colonel Mitchell

under your eye during the whole of the day,) that
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment repulsed repeated
attacks of cavalry, and by a rapid movement charged
a column of the enemy, and drove them to the extremity
of the wood on our right.</p>

</div>

<p>The Prussians had been attacked on the 16th of
June at Ligny, and were forced to retreat to Wavre,
and the Duke of Wellington made a corresponding
movement to keep up his communication with them.
In the course of the morning of the 17th of June, the
troops were withdrawn from Quatre Bras, and the
regiment was directed to form the rear-guard of the
infantry, until it occupied its position in front of
<i>Waterloo</i>, at a place named Mont St. Jean, where it
arrived without being molested by the enemy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the memorable battle of
Waterloo, which commenced about ten o’clock in the
morning of the 18th of June, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment, under the command of Major McDonald,
with the rest of Sir Denis Pack’s brigade, was placed
in support of some Belgian troops on the left of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
main road to Brussels, and throughout the day was
exposed to the fire of the enemy’s artillery and sharpshooters.</p>

<p>The allied troops to the right having repulsed the
repeated attacks in that quarter, the enemy directed
his attention in a more particular manner to this part
of the British line; and after having succeeded in
carrying the farm-house of <i lang="fr">La Haye Sainte</i>, under a
most tremendous fire of artillery, he drove the Belgians
from their post, and established himself in that part of
the position. The moment the Belgians were seen
running past the regiment to the rear, the third
battalion of the Royals, and the second battalion of the
forty-fourth regiment on its right in brigade, moved
to the point which had thus been abandoned, and for
some time maintained their ground in a manner becoming
British soldiers, although ultimately obliged to
give way. The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> at this time was reduced
to less than three hundred men. A column of
three thousand French was formed in the position in front
of the regiment, which was concealed by the nature of the
ground. The French Commander having possessed himself
of so advantageous a post, and seeing the troops give
way, considered everything gained, and ordered arms.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs, when Major-General
Sir Denis Pack galloped up to the regiment, and
called out “<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, you must charge, for all
the troops to your right and left have given way.”
Three cheers from the regiment expressed the devoted
readiness of every individual in its ranks.</p>

<p>The French column did not show a large front. The
regiment formed four deep, and in that compact order
advanced, until within twenty paces, when it fired a
volley, and instantly darted into the heart of the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
column, in which it became almost invisible, in the
midst of the mass opposed to it.</p>

<p>While the regiment was in the act of charging, and
the instant before it came in contact with the enemy,
the Scots Greys (second dragoons) came trotting up
in rear of its flanks, when both corps shouted “<em>Scotland
for ever!</em>” the column was instantaneously broken, and
in its flight the cavalry rode over it. The result of
this dash, which only occupied a few minutes, was a
loss to the enemy of two Eagles, and two thousand
prisoners, those that escaped doing so without arms or
knapsacks.</p>

<p>After this brilliant affair, Sir Denis Pack rode up
to the regiment, and said, “You have saved the day
Highlanders, but you must return to your position;
there is more work to be done!”</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to detail every part that
the regiment had to act on this eventful day; how it
stood in square, in line, and in column, never yielding
an inch to enemies who considered themselves invincible
when fighting, as in the present instance, under the
direction and in the presence of their Emperor
Napoleon Bonaparte, who frequently expressed his
astonishment and admiration at the manner in which
the British fought, particularly “<em lang="fr">Les Braves Ecossais</em>,”
as he termed them.</p>

<p>Towards evening two Prussian officers rode past the
regiment inquiring for the Duke of Wellington, and
their columns began to appear moving upon the
enemy’s right, by the road from Wavre. At this time
the French made a last effort by a general attack
throughout the whole line, and the moment they were
repulsed, the allied troops advanced, drove them from
every position, and forced them to seek safety in flight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
leaving their artillery, and everything that constitutes
an army in the field.</p>

<p>The regiment was directed to desist from the pursuit,
and return to its original ground, after giving
three British cheers to the Prussian army. In this
manner was achieved the Battle of Waterloo, the importance
of which may be best estimated by the
lengthened peace which has ensued; and the memory
of this eventful victory will ever survive as a proud
monument of the national glory of the British army.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment
had Captains Peter Wilkie and Archibald Ferrier,
Lieutenants Robert Winchester, Donald McDonald,
James Ker Ross, and James Hope wounded. Fourteen
rank and file were killed, and ninety-six wounded.</p>

<p>In acknowledgment of the services which the army
performed in the battle of Waterloo, and the actions
immediately preceding it, each subaltern officer and
soldier present was permitted to count two years additional
service, and silver medals were conferred on all
ranks, bearing on the one side an impression of His
Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and on the reverse
the figure of Victory, holding the palm in the right
hand, and the olive branch in the left, with the word
“<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>,” over its head, and “<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>,”
18th June, 1815, at its feet.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel James Mitchell, who succeeded to the
command of the regiment <ins class="corr" id="tn-97" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'at Quartre Bras'">
at Quatre Bras</ins>, was appointed
a companion of the Most Honorable Order of
the Bath, and had the Order of St. Anne of Russia
conferred upon him. Major Donald McDonald, who
commanded the regiment during the whole of the
battle of Waterloo, was promoted to the brevet rank of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Lieut.-Colonel, appointed a companion of the Bath,
and received the order of St. Wladimir of Russia.</p>

<p>The thanks of both Houses of Parliament were voted
to the army with the greatest enthusiasm “for its distinguished
valour at Waterloo;” and the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>,
and other regiments engaged, were permitted
to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>” on their colours and
appointments.</p>

<p>The Highland Society of Scotland unanimously
passed a vote of thanks “for the determined valour
and exertions displayed by the regiment, and for the
credit which it did its country in the memorable
battles of the 16th and 18th of June, 1815.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of June, the allied army resumed its
triumphant pursuit of the French towards Paris, in
the neighbourhood of which city the regiment encamped
on the 3rd of July, without having been employed on
any affair of consequence during the march.</p>

<p>The following General Order was issued by the
Duke of Wellington, on the 4th of <span class="nowrap">July:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Field Marshal has great satisfaction in announcing
to the troops under his command, that he
has, in concert with Field Marshal Prince Blucher,
concluded a military convention with the Commander-in-Chief
of the French army near Paris, by which the
enemy is to evacuate St. Denis, St. Ouen, Clichy,
and Neuilly, this day at noon, the heights of Monte
Martre to-morrow at noon, and Paris next day.</p>

<p>“The Field Marshal congratulates the army upon
this result of their glorious victory. He desires

and to-morrow, to clean their arms, clothes, and appointments,

<p>Louis XVIII. entered Paris on the 8th of July, and
was once more reinstated on the throne of France.
Napoleon Bonaparte having fled to the south of France
surrendered himself a prisoner on the 15th of July to
Captain Maitland, commanding the “Bellerophon”
British ship of war, and the island of St. Helena was
afterwards appointed for his residence.</p>

<p>While in camp near Paris, the British army was reviewed
by the Emperors of Austria and Russia, and
other Sovereigns in alliance with Great Britain, who
paid very high compliments to the regiment, and
greatly admired its Highland costume.</p>

<p>On the 28th of October, the regiment, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Mitchell, broke up from its
encampment, and marched to St. Germains; on the
30th to Montain Ville; and on the 2nd of November to
Neuf le Vieux.</p>

<p>The regiment marched on the 10th of November to
occupy the following villages—Monfort, Neuf de Vieux,
Creçy, Mareile, and Mere.</p>

<p>The Brigade orders of the 29th of November, directed
the regiment to proceed en route to Boulogne, and
Major-General Sir Denis Pack, after alluding to the
orderly and soldier-like conduct of the regiment both in
camp and quarters, and expressing his regret at losing
it from under his command, concluded as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The services rendered by the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment in the Duke of Wellington’s campaigns in
the Peninsula, and His Grace’s late short and
triumphant one in Belgium, are so generally and so
highly appreciated, as to make praise from him almost
idle; nevertheless, he cannot help adding his tribute
of applause.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 30th of November, the regiment marched to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Meulan, and arrived on the 15th of December at St.
Leonard, near Boulogne; on the 17th it arrived at
Calais, and embarked the same day for England.</p>

<p>The effective strength of the regiment consisted of
thirty-six serjeants, sixteen drummers, and four
hundred and forty-nine rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 19th of December, the regiment landed at
Margate; on the 20th marched to Deal; on the 21st
to Dover; and on the 22nd to Braebournlees Barracks,
from whence it proceeded <i lang="fr">en route</i> to Colchester on
the 28th of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The regiment arrived at Colchester on the 1st of
January, 1816, where an authority was received to reduce
its establishment to eight hundred rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 19th of February, the regiment marched
from Colchester <i lang="fr">en route</i> to Hull, where it arrived on
the 2nd of March. On the 22nd of August, the regiment
proceeded to Berwick-upon-Tweed,—from whence
it marched to Edinburgh on the 7th of September,
and on the 12th went into quarters in Edinburgh
Castle, being the second visit to its native country
since the original formation of the regiment.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, having expressed
a wish to see the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, it
was paraded on the 22nd of December accordingly,
and His Imperial Highness expressed his admiration
of the corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>On the 7th of April, 1817, the regiment commenced
its march by divisions to Port Patrick, there to embark
for Ireland. It arrived at Belfast on the 24th of April,
and on the 26th, detachments were sent to occupy
barracks at Carrickfergus, Downpatrick, Crumlin,
Ballimony, Newton Glens, Castle Dawson, Ballycastle,
and Randalstown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>Major-General Sir Sidney Beckwith inspected the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment on the 28th of April, 1818,
who issued a very complimentary order regarding its
appearance.</p>

<p>On the 17th of June, the regiment commenced its
march in two divisions for Castlebar, where the head-quarters
arrived on the 28th, having about twenty detachments
in various places.</p>

<p>The regiment was inspected on the 14th of October
by Major-General Buller, who expressed his approbation
of its appearance.</p>

<p>On the 4th of November, orders were received for the
regiment to be held in readiness for embarkation at
Cork, for Jamaica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p id="tn-101">The regiment marched on the 8th of January, 1819,
for Fermoy, where it arrived on the 20th of that month.
On the 12th of April, it marched from Fermoy to
Middleton barracks, and on the following day it embarked,
at the Cove of Cork, on board the “Chapman,”
“Nautilus,” and “Ocean” transports. The effective
strength consisted of thirty-one serjeants, twenty-one
drummers, and six hundred and three rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 14th of April, Major-General Benjamin
Gordon expressed “his marked approbation of the
steadiness and very soldier-like appearance of the
regiment, and the regularity with which its embarkation
was conducted yesterday.”</p>

<p>The regiment sailed on the 16th of April, and arrived
at Jamaica on the 2nd of June. It disembarked
at Kingston on the 4th of that month, and proceeded
to Up-Park Camp, followed by the whole population
of the town and its vicinity, who crowded from all
quarters to witness so novel a sight as a Highland
regiment in Jamaica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>Shortly after its arrival in Jamaica, the regiment
was attacked by yellow fever in its most virulent form,
and three companies, under the command of Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel Blainey, marched, on the 5th of July, to
Stony Hill barracks.</p>

<p>Such was the mortality and sickness in the regiment,
that it was, in August, in a manner ordered to be dispersed.
Another company marched on the 26th of
August to Stony Hill, and a part of one to the Apostles’
battery. On the 28th of August a strong detachment,
chiefly composed of convalescents, embarked on
board the “Serapis” guard-ship, then at anchor off
Port Royal.</p>

<p>Major Archibald Ferrier died at Up-Park Camp on
the 22nd of September, and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
John Blainey having died on the 28th of August at
Stony Hill, Brevet-Major Peter Wilkie assumed the
command of the regiment, and on the 23rd of September
removed with the head-quarters on board the
“Serapis.” Nothing can depict the state of the regiment
better than the following letter from Brevet-Major
Wilkie to Lieut.-Colonel Campbell, Assistant Adjutant-General
at <span class="nowrap">Jamaica:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

Tuesday or Wednesday next, as having unfortunately
lost the Adjutant, and every one acquainted with the
important duty of the orderly room, in the course of
the present month, I have consequently been necessitated
to take into it any one that could write. Under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
these circumstances, I trust you will grant me all the

</div>

<p>The head-quarters were removed on the 9th of
November from on board the “Serapis,” and returned
to Up-Park Camp, where the several detachments
joined, and the regiment was again assembled. It
was remarked that the men who had been on board
ship continued perfectly healthy after their return,
whereas those who had been stationed at Stony Hill
and the Apostles’ Battery, suffered considerably.</p>

<p>The total loss sustained by the regiment from the
25th of June to the 24th of December, 1819, consisted
of ten officers,—namely, Majors Archibald Ferrier,
and John Blainey (Brevet Lieut.-Colonel), Lieutenants
Andrew Will, Thomas Gordon, Hector Innes,
George Logan, Richard McDonnell, and George
Mackie (Adjutant), Ensign Francis Reynolds, and Assistant
Surgeon David Thomas; thirteen serjeants, eight
drummers, and two hundred and fifty-four rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>Lieut.-General John Hope was appointed colonel of
the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> on the 29th of January, 1820, in
succession to General the Earl of Hopetoun, G.C.B.,
who was removed to the Forty-second, Royal Highland
regiment.</p>

<p>The regiment was inspected on the 16th of February
by Major-General Henry Conran, who expressed
himself much pleased with the appearance and steadiness
of the men under arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>On the 10th of March, the head-quarters and five
companies were removed from Up-Park Camp to Fort
Augusta; and on the 14th of that month the other five
companies proceeded to Port Royal. In both places
the regiment enjoyed comparatively good health.</p>

<p>A detachment of fifty-five rank and file joined the
regiment from Scotland on the 24th of May.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Sir Frederick Stovin, K.C.B., who
was promoted from the twenty-eighth to the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment on the 2nd of September of the previous
year, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel James
Mitchell, who retired from the service, joined at
Jamaica on the 24th of October 1820.</p>

<p>The regimental orders of the 30th of October directed
that the dress, on parades and duties, should be white
trousers, and that no other dress would be permitted.</p>

<p>On the 21st of December, two companies of the
regiment marched from Fort Augusta to Spanish Town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>The head-quarters and three companies at Fort
Augusta marched on the 3rd of January, 1821, to
Spanish Town, and on the 4th, the five companies at
Port Royal were removed to Fort Augusta: one of
them was shortly afterwards ordered to join the head-quarters
at Spanish Town.</p>

<p>A detachment of one hundred and eighty-five rank
and file joined at Jamaica from the regimental depôt
on the 13th of January, and on the 5th of February
another detachment of twenty-nine joined, making a
total of two hundred and fourteen men.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March, the regiment was again inspected
by Major-General Henry Conran, commanding
the forces at Jamaica, who expressed his approbation of
the correct field movements and interior regularity of
all its departments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Sir Frederick Stovin, having on the
21st of June obtained leave of absence to return to
England, Major Peter Wilkie assumed the command
of the regiment. On the 18th of August one of the
four companies stationed at Fort Augusta marched to
join the head-quarters at Spanish Town; and on the
17th of October, the three companies at Fort Augusta,
were removed to Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 24th of October, orders were received from
the Secretary at War to reduce the regiment to an establishment
of eight companies, consisting of twenty-nine
serjeants, twelve drummers, and five hundred and
seventy-six rank and file. In consequence of this order,
the regiment was formed into eight companies, six being
stationed at head-quarters in Spanish Town, and two at
Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November, a detachment of the regiment,
consisting of two subalterns, two serjeants, one
drummer, and thirty-two rank and file, embarked for
New Providence.</p>

<p>The fifty-eighth and sixty-first regiments being about
to return to Europe, a general order was issued on the
28th of November, permitting the men to volunteer to
other corps serving in Jamaica; consequently, thirty-three
men from the fifty-eighth, and forty-seven from
the sixty-first, joined the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>On the 15th of February, 1822, the two companies
of the regiment stationed at Port Royal embarked for
Port Antonio, where they were detached. On the 19th
of February, the head-quarters and three companies
marched from Spanish Town, embarked on the same
day at Port Henderson, and landed at Falmouth on the
24th of that month; the other three companies embarked
shortly afterwards for Montego Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>In March the regiment was stationed as follows:
head-quarters and two companies at Falmouth, two
companies at Port Antonio, two companies at Lucca,
and two companies at Maroon Town.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel David Williamson joined at Falmouth,
in Jamaica, on the 10th of April, and assumed
the command of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, to which he had
been appointed from half-pay of the fourth regiment,
on the 4th of October of the previous year.</p>

<p>A detachment of recruits, consisting of sixty-nine
rank and file, joined on the 25th of April. At this
period the officers of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> were directed
to wear wings, instead of two bullion epaulets for all
ranks as heretofore.</p>

<p>One of the two companies stationed at Lucea marched
on the 23rd of August to Montego Bay, and on the 27th
of November was moved from thence to Maroon Town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>Major-General Sir John Keane, K.C.B., assumed
the command of the troops in Jamaica, on the 1st of
May, 1823, and in the early part of June visited the
different stations of the regiment, when he approved
highly of its discipline and appearance.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General the Honorable Alexander Duff was
appointed colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> on the 6th of
September, 1823, in succession to Lieut.-General Sir
John Hope, G.C.H., who was removed to the seventy-second
regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1824</div>

<p>A detachment of thirty recruits joined on the 10th
of February, 1824, and they were stationed at Fort Augusta.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment marched from
Falmouth to Montego Bay on the 5th of April, where
they arrived at daylight on the following morning;
and on the 7th embarked in H. M. ship “Pyramus,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the other two divisions embarking about the same time.
The regiment landed at Fort Augusta on the 10th,
12th, and 16th of April. Six companies and the head-quarters
remained at Fort Augusta, and two companies
were detached to Kingston Barracks.</p>

<p>During the two years the regiment was stationed on
the north side, the men enjoyed a high state of health,
considering the climate of Jamaica. Of their conduct
in quarters, the best judgment may be formed from the
following address presented to Lieut.-Colonel Williamson,
by a committee of the magistrates and vestry of
Trelawny appointed for that <span class="nowrap">purpose:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">“Court House, Falmouth.<br>

the time they have been stationed among us. In
expressing our satisfaction at the cordiality that has
prevailed between your regiment and the inhabitants

<p>About the middle of April, the recruits which had
lately joined were attacked by fever, which carried off
one-third of their number.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, the regiment, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Williamson, was inspected by Major-General
Sir John Keane, who expressed himself highly
pleased with the movements, and the attention which
the men appeared to have paid to the new system of
drill, prescribed by the General Order of the 10th of
March, 1824, according to the improvements introduced
by Major-General Sir Henry Torrens, K.C.B., Adjutant-General
of the Forces.</p>

<p>Symptoms of insurrection having appeared among
the slaves on the north side of the island, four companies
of the regiment were embarked on the 25th of June
on board His Majesty’s ship “Hussar”; two of them were
landed on the 28th at Savanna la Mar, and were stationed
there; and on the 30th another was landed at
Black River; while the fourth remained on board the
frigate on its cruise round the island, and was again
landed at Fort Augusta, where the detachments at
Savanna la Mar, and Lacovia, joined the head-quarters
on the 6th and 7th of August.</p>

<p>On the 13th of September, Major Andrew Robert
Charlton assumed the command of the regiment, Lieut.-Colonel
Williamson having obtained leave of absence
to return to Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p id="tn-108">The head-quarters and the six companies at Fort
Augusta proceeded on the 13th of January, 1825, to
Up-Park Camp, where the two companies stationed at
Kingston joined on the following day, and the regiment
became united, having been more or less detached since
the 10th of March, 1820.</p>

<p>On the 14th of February, a detachment of twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
recruits arrived from England; and a detachment
of two officers and sixteen recruits joined from England
on the 25th of June.</p>

<p>In July orders were received fixing the establishment
of the regiment at ten companies; six <em>service</em> and four
<em>depôt</em> companies.</p>

<p>About the middle of July, the regiment was attacked
with fever, which, in the course of two months, carried
off Major Andrew Robert Charlton, Captain Andrew
Donaldson, Lieutenant and Adjutant James Deans,
and sixty men; the command then devolved on Captain
Robert Winchester, who was subsequently promoted
to the rank of major in the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>On the 10th of February, 1826, Lieut.-Colonel Williamson
and a detachment of three officers and sixty
men arrived from England on board of His Majesty’s
ship “Magnificent.”</p>

<p>Major-General Sir John Keane, K.C.B., on the 11th
of March, inspected the head-quarters of the regiment,
at Fort Augusta, under Major Winchester, he having
been in command the greater part of the time since
the last annual inspection, and expressed his entire
satisfaction at the soldier-like appearance of the men,
and their correct performance of the field exercises:
the flourishing state of the regimental school attracted
his particular notice amongst the various points of
interior economy.</p>

<p>In August the regiment received orders to be in
readiness for embarkation for England upon being
relieved by the eighty-fourth regiment.</p>

<p>The two companies at Kingston, marched, on the
23rd of December, to Up-Park Camp; two companies
from Fort Augusta replaced them; and, on the 24th,
the other two companies proceeded to Kingston Barracks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
where the head-quarters were established, leaving
the sick and hospital establishment at Fort
Augusta, a station which had been found an excellent
convalescent post.</p>

<p>Sickness prevailed to a considerable extent at
Kingston, and therefore changes continually took
place between the three stations, Fort Augusta,
Kingston, and Up-Park Camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>The first division of the eighty-fourth regiment
having arrived at Fort Augusta on the 3rd of February,
1827, the convalescents of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
were removed to Up-Park Camp, to await their
embarkation for Europe.</p>

<p>On the 19th of February, the head-quarters of the
regiment, under Lieut.-Colonel Williamson, embarked,
at Kingston, on board the “Arab” transport, and sailed
on the 24th, arriving at Spithead on the 25th of
April.</p>

<p>The head-quarter division was transshipped from the
“Arab” to the “Amphitrite” and “Zephyr” transports,
in Portsmouth harbour, and sailed for Leith Roads. It
landed at Leith on the 10th of May, and marched to
Edinburgh Castle, where the four depôt companies,
from Glasgow, joined on the 23rd of that month, and
were consolidated with the regiment.</p>

<p>The three companies which had been left at Up-Park
Camp, under the command of Major Winchester,
embarked at Kingston on the 30th of March, sailed
on the 3rd of April, landed at Portsmouth on the 21st
of May, and were quartered in Forton Barracks, re-embarked
on the 25th of May, and on the 31st, joined
the head-quarters at Edinburgh Castle, where the
regiment was assembled.</p>

<p>On the 27th of June, the regiment, under Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Williamson, was inspected by Major-General
Sir Robert W. O’Callaghan, K.C.B., commanding in
North Britain. Its strength consisted of thirty-seven
serjeants, eleven drummers, and six hundred and thirty-one
rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1828</div>

<p>Four companies, under the command of Major
Winchester, marched on the 25th of February, 1828,
for Glasgow Barracks.</p>

<p>The six companies at head-quarters in Edinburgh
Castle, were inspected by Major-General Sir Robert
O’Callaghan on the 3rd of April; on the 23rd, two
companies marched for Glasgow, and on the 24th were
followed by the other two companies with the head-quarters.
Two companies being left at Edinburgh
Castle, joined the head-quarters at Glasgow on the
30th of April.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Williamson having, on the 26th of
May, obtained leave of absence until further orders,
the command of the regiment devolved on Major
Winchester.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked on the 29th of July, and two
following days, on board the “Eclipse,” “Sheffield,” and
“Frolic” steam-boats, arriving at Belfast on the 30th
of July, and the two following days, where the regiment
was billeted.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of August, the regiment embarked at
Belfast, and landed on the following day at Dublin.</p>

<p>The regiment, commanded by Major Winchester,
was inspected on the 5th of August, in the Phœnix
Park, by Lieut.-General Sir John Byng, K.C.B.,
commanding the forces in Ireland, and on the 6th and
7th of that month marched for Fermoy, where the
divisions arrived on the 15th and 16th of August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>On the 19th of January, 1829, Lieut.-Colonel John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>

from the half-pay on the 21st of November of
the previous year.</p>

<p>Orders having been received directing that steel-mounted
swords should be adopted by Highland regiments,
the officers of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, immediately
supplied themselves with “<em>Claidheamh mor</em>,” similar
to those originally used in the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>A letter, dated 13th of April, 1830, was at this
period received from the Adjutant-General of the
Forces, authorising the adoption of regimental tartan
trousers for all occasions when the kilt is not worn.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May, the first division of the regiment
marched for Kilkenny, and was followed next
day by the head-quarters, at which place they arrived
on the 14th and 15th of May; detaching a company to
each of the following places—Carlow, Athy, and Maryborough.
On the 8th of June, another company
marched from head-quarters for New Ross.</p>

<p id="tn-112">The regiment, under Lieut.-Colonel John McDonald,

more pleased to find the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> greatly improved
since he last saw them, and in a state, which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
in their best days, they never surpassed; and that
immediately on his return to Dublin, he would make
a point of reporting the very high state of discipline
in which he found the regiment, and which, he was sure,
would also afford to General Lord Hill, a pleasure
the most sincere.”</p>

<p>The head-quarter division, consisting of three companies,
marched, on the 26th of May, <i lang="fr">en route</i> to Birr,
and the remaining three companies, under the command

place, detaching one company to Nenagh.</p>

<p>The head-quarters arrived at Birr on the 29th of
May, and the second division on the 31st of that month;
the companies from Maryborough, Carlow, Athy, and
Wexford arrived about the same period.</p>

<p>“The commanding officer directs the following address
from the magistrates of Queen’s County may be entered

approbation<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> so lately expressed by His Majesty’s

<p><span class="pad2">“We, the</span> undersigned magistrates of Maryborough

ourselves of this, the earliest opportunity of expressing
our high approbation of the conduct of the different
detachments of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> Highlanders,
quartered in the town of Maryborough for the last
twelve months. In justice to the excellent character
of the men, we feel called upon to testify, that not a
single complaint was made by the inhabitants against
any of them, and that their conduct was uniformly
correct and exemplary.</p>

<p>“The general zeal and intelligence of the officers,
supported by the steadiness and discipline of the men,
when co-operating with the civil power, particularly
during the last winter (in suppressing outrages of a

hitherto peaceable county), demand our cordial thanks;

</div>

<p>On the 18th of June, the regiment was reviewed by
Major-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, K.C.B., commanding
the Western District. It being the anniversary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of the battle of Waterloo, the regiments performed
a variety of movements, as executed on that memorable
day; the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> afterwards went through
the sword exercise, &amp;c., and the Major-General was
pleased to express his approbation of the splendid appearance
which the regiment made on that occasion.</p>

<p>On the 8th of October, the head-quarter division,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel McDonald, and,
on the following day, the second division, under Major
Winchester, marched from Birr <i lang="fr">en route</i> to Dublin,
arriving there on the 13th and 14th October respectively,
and were quartered in the Royal Barracks.</p>

<p>The regiment was inspected on the 30th of October
by Major-General Sir Edward Blakeney, K.C.B., who
expressed his unqualified approbation of its appearance
and interior arrangements.</p>

<p>At this period an address was received from the
magistrates of Nenagh, (Lord Dunally in the chair,)
relative to the good conduct of the detachment of the
regiment, under Captain William Prittie Bayly, lately
stationed at that place.</p>

<p>On the 13th of December, the regiment was formed
in the Palatine Square to receive His Excellency
Lieut.-General the Right Honorable Sir John Byng,
K.C.B., commanding the forces in Ireland. A new
stand of colours (the gift of the officers) was escorted
by the grenadier company from the Lieut.-Colonel’s
quarters. His Excellency then made a most appropriate
and flattering speech, in which he alluded to the
anniversary of that day (the battle of the Nive), and
the brilliant and distinguished conduct of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
on the occasion, as well as on many others of
which he himself was an eye-witness. After receiving
the colours from the officers of the grenadiers, and remarking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
how delighted he was to see the names of so
many well-earned battles emblazoned on them, he
placed them in the hands of the ensigns, and the regiment
saluted.</p>

<p>Addressing Lieut.-Colonel McDonald, His Excellency
observed, “that he made no allusion to the necessity
of defending those colours,—that any such
remark would be out of place when addressing the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>,—however, he could not give the young
officers and soldiers better advice, than to follow the
steps of those who preceded them.”</p>

<p>To which the Lieut.-Colonel replied, “That if anything
could enhance the value attached to those
colours by the regiment, it was their being placed in
the hands of the ensigns by one who had that day
seventeen years shown himself so very conspicuous in
planting the colours of a regiment on the enemy’s
redoubts,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and that he pledged himself in the name
of his brother officers and soldiers for their honor and
safety.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>On the 23rd of December, the troops in garrison at
Dublin, were paraded in review-order to receive
General the Marquis of Anglesey, K.G., on his arrival
to assume the government of Ireland, and lined the
streets through which the procession passed to the
Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>A company of the regiment, in light marching order,
under the command of Captain James McIntosh, proceeded
on the 22nd of February, 1831, by forced
marches to Drumcondra, in the county of Meath,
which was in a state of disturbance, and where immense
assemblages of the population were traversing the
country.</p>

Adjutant-General (Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Charles
Fitzroy) on the 23rd of <span class="nowrap">February:—</span></p>

<p>The company which had been detached in the county
of Meath returned to its quarters on the 22nd of
March, and on the following day a letter was received,
expressive of the entire approbation of the Lord
Lieutenant of the services performed in the disturbed
district by the troops employed.</p>

<p>The regiment was removed from the Royal Barracks
on the 19th of April: the head-quarters, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel McDonald, consisting of
four companies, with the recruits, were stationed in the
New Barracks, and six companies, under Major Winchester,
at George-street.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Edward Blakeney, K.C.B.,
inspected the regiment on the 3rd of May, in the
Phœnix Park, in the presence of His Excellency the
Lord Lieutenant and a great concourse of spectators,
on which occasion its movements and appearance drew
forth the admiration of its military superiors.</p>

<p>The head-quarters and four companies from the
New Barracks, and four companies from George-street,
marched, on the 18th of May, to Richmond Barracks,
leaving two companies stationed in George-street,
under the command of Major Hugh Henry Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Hamilton Dalrymple, Bart.,
(afterwards the Earl of Stair) was appointed by His
Majesty King William IV., to be Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
on the 20th of July, in succession to Lieut.-General
the Honorable Alexander Duff, removed to
the thirty-seventh regiment.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Edward Blakeney, K.C.B., again
reviewed the regiment in the Phœnix Park, on the 10th
of September, in heavy marching order, and addressing
the officers and men, he said, “that they were all he
could wish, and that their movements excelled everything
he had ever seen.”</p>

<p>On the 26th of September, His Majesty conferred
the honorary distinction of a Knight Companion of the
most Honorable Military Order of the Bath on Lieut.-Colonel
John McDonald, of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment.</p>

<p>The first division, consisting of four companies,
under the command of Brevet-Major Stephen Noel,
embarked on the 13th of October, and proceeded by
canal-conveyance to Killaloe: two companies followed
on the 17th, and the head-quarters and remaining
companies, on the 18th of October, under the command
of Major Winchester, Lieut.-Colonel McDonald,
having proceeded direct to the head-quarters at Clare
Castle, where they were stationed on the 22nd of
October, and the regiment was distributed at several
places in the county of Clare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>On the 9th of February, 1832, the head-quarter
division from Clare Castle marched into Limerick, and
was quartered in the New Barracks, where it was
joined by the several detachments in the course of
February and March.</p>

<p>A company, under the command of Captain John
Gilbert Ogilvie, proceeded, on the 22nd of March, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Mount Pleasant, near Askeaton, in the county of
Limerick, for the protection of property: it rejoined at
head-quarters on the 4th of April.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir George Bingham, K.C.B., made
his inspection of the regiment on the 7th of May, and
stated that he was particularly gratified by the manner
in which the officers and men went through the whole
of the sword and stick exercise, being the first time he
had ever seen it performed by an entire regiment.
The appearance, movements, and interior economy of
the regiment drew forth his commendation.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May, the regiment marched from
Limerick for Fermoy.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General the Right Honorable Sir Hussey
Vivian, Bart., K.C.B., commanding the forces in Ireland,
inspected the regiment on the 6th of August, and
expressed himself highly pleased with its appearance.</p>

<p>The subaltern’s detachment, stationed at Galbally,
in the county of Limerick, was, on the 21st of December,
called upon to protect the persons of two magistrates
whose lives were endangered by the attack of a
mob, while proceeding from thence towards Tipperary;
at a place called Knockballinamaloo-Cross, the party
were assailed with stones, and a general assault made
on the troops, to their imminent danger. The magistrates
ordered them to fire, and the result was that two
of the mob were killed and several wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment was frequently employed in aid of the
civil power, in keeping the peace, and in enforcing the
collection of tithes; and in every instance its conduct
and discipline received unqualified approval.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>On the 1st of August, 1833, the regiment was
divided into six service and four depôt companies, preparatory
to the embarkation of the former for Gibraltar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>The depôt companies marched from Fermoy to Cork,
and embarked for Londonderry, where they arrived on
the 17th of August.</p>

<p>The depôt companies embarked at Londonderry on
the 28th of October, and arrived at Glasgow on the
29th of that month; on the 30th of November they
marched for Greenlaw.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>The service companies having marched from Fermoy
to Middleton, were conveyed in boats to Cork
Harbour, where they embarked on the 21st of February,
1834, and arrived at <i>Gibraltar</i> on the 10th of March.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, 1834, the depôt companies were

<p>During the year 1837, the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> remained
stationed at Malta.</p>

<p>The regiment was inspected by Major-General Sir
Henry Bouverie, K.C.B., commanding at Malta, on
the 28th of November, when he remarked “the singular
intelligence and steadiness shown by all the officers
and men;” and added, “that the field-day had the
best effect of any he had ever witnessed.”</p>

<p>In May the depôt companies proceeded from Londonderry
to Armagh, and in September following to
Mullingar.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1838</div>

<p>The depôt companies were removed from Mullingar
to Nenagh in May, and in September proceeded to
Limerick.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July, 1838, His Royal Highness the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Prince Maximilian of Bavaria landed at Malta, and
attended a parade of the garrison: on the day following
he examined the barracks occupied by the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>,
and expressed himself much pleased with
every part of the interior economy of the regiment.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1838, the regiment lined
the ramparts at St. Elmo, while the “Hastings”
(seventy-four guns,) entered the harbour with Her
Majesty the Queen Dowager on board. On the following
day the regiment was formed as a Guard of Honor in the
square in front of the palace to receive Her Majesty,
who landed to examine the accommodation prepared
for her, and returned again on board the “Hastings.”</p>

<p>On the 4th of December, the Queen Dowager landed
amidst the rejoicings of the inhabitants, and occupied
the palace. The field officers, and the heads of departments,
were presented to Her Majesty by the Governor
in the evening, and the town and public buildings were
splendidly illuminated.</p>

<p>The Queen Dowager held a levée at the palace on
the 12th of December, when all the officers were presented.
The Earl Howe, Lord Chamberlain, having
previously intimated Her Majesty’s desire to see the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND HIGHLAND REGIMENT</span>, whenever it
might be convenient, the officers, immediately after
the levée, repaired to their companies, and the regiment
was formed in review-order on the Floriana
Parade. After the regiment had marched past in slow
and quick time, and performed several movements,
Her Majesty expressed herself highly pleased with
the appearance of the corps.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1839</div>

<p>In January, 1839, the depôt companies proceeded
from Limerick to Birr, where they were stationed

received for military aid to suppress a serious disturbance
at Kingstown, St. Vincent; the conduct of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> on this occasion received the thanks of
the President of the Council and the House of Assembly
of St. Vincent.</p>

<p>On the 6th of April, 1846, a letter of thanks was
received from the Magistrates and Commissioners of
Police of Edinburgh, for the promptness and efficiency
with which a piquet of the regiment, under Captain
Sutherland, attended, and assisted in saving property,
and preserving order, during a calamitous fire at night
in the New Town of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment embarked for Belfast
in April, 1846, and in August following was removed
to Enniskillen.</p>

<p>Major John Alexander Forbes was promoted to the

<p>In May, 1847, the regiment was removed from
Enniskillen to Dublin, and in December it proceeded
to Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1848</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded in December, 1848, from
Limerick to Clonmel, in the Kilkenny district, which
was under the command of Major-General John
McDonald; his former regiment thus became again
under his orders.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1849</div>

<div class="sidenote">1851</div>

<p>In February, 1851, the service companies proceeded
from Kilkenny to Fermoy, and the depôt companies to
Carlow: a complimentary address was received from
the mayor and citizens of Kilkenny, on the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
quitting that city, expressive of the regret they
experienced in parting with the regiment, the conduct
of which had gained the esteem of all classes.</p>

<p>The service companies embarked at Cork on the
14th of April, on board of Her Majesty’s troop-ship
“Apollo” and the freight ship “Edmonstone” for
Corfu, the head-quarters being under the command of

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, K.B., was promoted to

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Colonel the Marquis of Huntly commanded the regiment in
this memorable charge, which began and decided the action at
Egmont-op-Zee: all the rest was a pursuit. The Marquis of
Huntly, and Major-General (afterwards Sir John) Moore, were
wounded, and the command of the regiment devolved upon
Lieut.-Colonel Erskine.</p>

<p>Major-General Moore was carried to the surgeon by two soldiers
of the regiment; and a few years afterwards, when writing for a
drawing of the uniform, for the purpose of having a soldier of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> as one of the supporters to his coat of arms, on being
made a Knight of the Bath, he mentioned the circumstance of their
having remarked—“There is the General, we must take him to the
doctor:” and then added, “We can do no more; we must join the
lads, for every man is wanted!!” Major-General Moore, on his
recovery, inquired for those men in order to reward them, and
offered twenty pounds, but no one claimed it; and he remarked, that
“it was a noble trait of the regiment, that no men in its ranks came
forward to personate the parties, or to claim the reward.”—It
was, therefore, supposed they were killed.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that this is one of the few instances on record
of <em>crossing bayonets</em> by large bodies. Even the supernumerary rank
of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> on this occasion was bayoneted; among the
number Lieutenant McCardy was killed, and Lieutenant Donald
McDonald (who afterwards succeeded to the command of the regiment
at Waterloo) received three bayonet wounds.</p>

<p class="center smcap">George, Marquis of Huntly.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Appointed 3rd May, 1796.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">George, Marquis of Huntly, son of Alexander, fourth
Duke of Gordon, choosing the profession of arms, was appointed
to a commission in the thirty-fifth regiment in
1790. In the same year he raised an independent company
of Highlanders; and exchanging, in January, 1791, to the
forty-second regiment, he brought with him a fine band
of young Highlanders. On the 11th of July, 1792, he was
promoted to captain-lieutenant and lieutenant-colonel in the
third Foot Guards. He accompanied the detachment of
Foot Guards to Flanders in the spring of 1793, was at the
action of St. Amand on the 8th of May, and was engaged in
driving the French from the position at the village of Famars
on the 23rd of May. He was subsequently employed at the
siege of Valenciennes, which fortress surrendered to the
Duke of York in July. On the 18th of August he was engaged
at Lincelles; and he afterwards served at the siege of
Dunkirk. When the army went into winter quarters, the
<span class="smcap">Marquis of Huntly</span> returned to England, and in the following
year was raised a corps of Highlanders, which was numbered
the <i>hundredth</i> regiment, now the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>, of
which he was appointed lieutenant-colonel commandant on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the 10th of February, 1794. He accompanied his regiment
to Gibraltar; and on his return to England, he was captured
by a French privateer. He afterwards rejoined his regiment
at the island of Corsica, where he served upwards of a year;
and on the 3rd of May, 1796, he was promoted to the rank of
colonel. On the breaking out of the rebellion in Ireland,
in 1798, he joined his regiment in that country, where he
served as brigadier-general, and was actively employed
against the rebels, particularly in Wexford. He accompanied
the expedition to Holland in 1799, was at the landing
at the Helder, and continued actively employed until
the 2nd of October, when he was wounded at the battle of
Egmont-op-Zee. On the 1st of January, 1801, he was promoted
to the rank of major-general; and in 1803 he was appointed
to the staff of North Britain, where he served three
years. In January, 1806, he was appointed to the colonelcy
of the forty-second, or the Royal Highlanders; and in April,
1808, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general.
He commanded a division in the expedition to Holland in
1809; and in August, 1819, he was advanced to the rank of
general. In 1820 he was removed to the first,—the Royal
Regiment of Foot,—and in a few months afterwards he was
nominated a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable
Military Order of the Bath. In 1827 he succeeded, on the
decease of his father, to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Duke of Gordon</span>: he
was also appointed Governor of Edinburgh Castle, and
Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. In 1834 he was removed
to the Scots Fusilier Guards. He was distinguished
as a kind-hearted and gallant nobleman and soldier,—contributing
largely to many charitable institutions. His social,
private, and public virtues, endeared him to his family and
friends; and a succession of uninterrupted acts of philanthropy
procured him universal esteem. He died on the 28th
of May, 1836; and his remains, by especial command of his
Majesty King William IV., were escorted by the first
battalion of the Scots Fusilier Guards from London to
Greenwich, where they were placed on board a steam-vessel,
for the purpose of being conveyed to Scotland for interment
in a mausoleum erected on the paternal estate. By his
Grace’s decease the dukedom became extinct.</p>

<p class="p2 center smcap">John, Earl of Hopetoun, G.C.B.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Appointed 3rd January, 1806.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">The Honorable John Hope, son of John, second Earl
of Hopetoun, evinced a predilection for the profession of
arms from his youth, and served as a volunteer in his fifteenth
year. On the 28th of May, 1784, he was appointed cornet
in the tenth Light Dragoons; two years afterwards, he was
nominated lieutenant in the twenty-seventh foot, and in 1789,
captain in the seventeenth Light Dragoons; in 1792, he was
promoted major in the first foot, and in the following year,
lieutenant-colonel in the twenty-fifth regiment, with which
corps he served in the West Indies, where he was appointed
adjutant-general, and served the campaigns of 1794, 1795,
1796, and 1797, with great distinction, being particularly
noticed in the orders and public despatches of Lieutenant-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby, and other commanders. In
1796, he was elected a member of parliament for the county
of Linlithgow. He was nominated deputy adjutant-general
to the expedition to Holland in 1799, and was severely
wounded at the landing in North Holland on the 27th of
August. In 1800, he was appointed adjutant-general to the
army in the Mediterranean, under Lieutenant-General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, and served in the expedition to Egypt:
he was at the actions of the 8th and 13th of March, 1801,
and was wounded before Alexandria on the 21st of March,
when Sir Ralph Abercromby received a wound, of which
he died on the 28th of March. Brigadier-General Hope
recovered, and requesting to have a brigade, was succeeded
as adjutant-general by Colonel Abercromby. On the 16th
of June, he joined the army before Cairo, with the twenty-eighth
and forty-second regiments, and he afterwards evinced
ability in conducting the negotiations for the surrender of the
capital of Egypt by the French troops, under General Belliard.
He continued in the command of a brigade until the deliverance
of Egypt was accomplished, and received the second class of
the Order of the Crescent established by the Grand Seignior.
In 1802, his services were rewarded by the colonelcy of the
North Lowland Fencible Infantry, and the rank of major-general;
to which was added, in June, 1805, the appointment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of deputy-governor of Portsmouth; but he resigned this
appointment soon afterwards, to accompany the troops sent to
Hanover under Lieutenant-General Lord Cathcart. In
October, 1805, he was appointed colonel commandant of a
battalion of the sixtieth regiment; and in 1806, he succeeded
the Marquis of Huntly in the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span>
regiment. On the 25th of April, 1808, he was promoted to
the rank of lieutenant-general. He was nominated second in
command of the expedition to the Baltic, under Lieutenant-General
Sir John Moore, and afterwards accompanied the
troops to Portugal. He commanded a division of the army
which advanced into Spain, under Sir John Moore, and shared
in that campaign; and in the battle of Corunna, when he succeeded
to the command of the army,—Sir John Moore being
killed, and Sir David Baird wounded—he was successful in
repulsing the attack of the French under Marshal Soult. On
the embarkation of the army, he took particular care to prevent
any soldier being left behind, and was the last man who went
on board the fleet. His despatch contains an interesting account
of the battle.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He was thanked for his distinguished services
by parliament, was honored with the approbation of his Sovereign,
and the admiration and applause of his country; and
was nominated a Knight of the Most Honorable Military
Order of the Bath. After his return from Spain, he served
with the Walcheren expedition, under General the Earl of
Chatham, and was subsequently appointed commander-in-chief
in Ireland, from which he was removed, in 1813, to the
appointment of second in command in the peninsula. Lieutenant-General
<span class="smcap">Sir John Hope</span>, commanded the left wing of
the army at the battle of the Nivelle on the 10th of November,
and signalized himself at the battle of the Nive, in December;
on which occasion the British commander stated in his public
despatch—“I cannot sufficiently applaud the ability, coolness,
and judgment, of Lieutenant-General Sir John Hope.”
He passed the Adour with the left wing of the army in
February, 1814, and blockaded the important fortress of
Bayonne,—in which service he evinced great ability and
perseverance: and he remained in the command of the
blockading force until the termination of the war. After
Napoleon had abdicated, the French commandant at Bayonne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
not believing the news, made a sortie on the night of the 14th
of April, and gained some advantage. Lieutenant-General
<span class="smcap">Sir John Hope</span> coming up with some troops in the dark,
encountered the enemy, when his horse being shot, fell upon
him, and he was wounded and taken prisoner. The French
were, however, repulsed. At the restoration of peace, he
returned to England with a high reputation. He received
the thanks of parliament; a medal and a clasp for the battles
of Corunna and the Nive; was elevated to the peerage of the
United Kingdom by the title of <span class="smcap">Baron Niddry</span>, of Niddry,
in the county of Linlithgow, and was nominated a Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Military Order of the
Bath. He afterwards succeeded to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Earl of
Hopetoun</span>. In 1819, he was promoted to the rank of
General, and was appointed colonel of the forty-second, or
the Royal Highlanders, in 1820. He died at Paris on the
27th of August, 1823.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Sir John Hope, G.C.H.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Appointed 29th January, 1820.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">John Hope entered the Dutch service, as a cadet, in one of
the regiments of the <i>Scots Brigade</i> (Houston’s) in the service
of the United Provinces, in 1778, and served at Bergen-op-Zoom
and Maestretcht, going through the subordinate ranks of corporal
and serjeant. In 1779 he was appointed ensign, and in
1782 he was promoted captain of a company; but, being called
upon to renounce his allegiance to the British monarch, he quitted
the Dutch service, and in 1787 he was appointed captain in
the sixtieth foot, but his company was soon afterwards reduced.
On the 30th of June, 1788, he was appointed captain in the
thirteenth Light Dragoons, and in 1792 he was nominated
aide-de-camp to Lieut.-General Sir William Erskine, in which
capacity he served the campaigns of 1793 and 1794, in
Holland, and returned to England in 1795, when he was promoted
to the majority of the twenty-eighth Light Dragoons,
and in 1796 to the lieut.-colonelcy of the same corps, with
which he embarked for the Cape of Good Hope in the
same year. He served at the Cape until 1799, when his
regiment was incorporated in other corps, and he returned to
England. In April, 1799, he was appointed to the thirty-seventh
foot, which corps he joined, in 1800, in the West<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Indies, where he remained until 1804, when he returned to
England, and exchanged to the sixtieth regiment. In 1805
he was nominated assistant adjutant-general in Scotland, and
in 1807 he served as deputy adjutant-general to the expedition
to Copenhagen, under Lieut.-General Lord Cathcart.
He was appointed brigadier-general on the staff of North
Britain in 1808, and subsequently deputy adjutant-general in
that part of the United Kingdom. He was promoted to the
rank of major-general in 1810, and appointed to the staff of
the Severn district, from whence he was removed to the staff
of the Peninsula in 1812, and served with the army under
the Duke of Wellington at the battle of Salamanca, for which
he received a medal. He subsequently served on the staff of
Ireland and North Britain until 1819, when he was promoted
to the rank of lieut.-general. He was honored with the
dignity of Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Hanoverian
Guelphic Order. In 1820 he was appointed colonel of the
<span class="allsmcap">NINETY-SECOND</span> regiment, from which he was removed, in
1823, to the seventy-second Highlanders. He died in August
1836.</p>

“<i>16th May, 1801.</i></p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">General Orders.</span></div>

<div class="p1">“The recent events which have occurred in Egypt have
induced His Majesty to lay his most gracious commands on
His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief, to convey to
the troops employed in that country His Majesty’s highest
approbation of their conduct; and at the same time His
Majesty has deemed it expedient that these his gracious sentiments
should be communicated to every part of his army, not
doubting that all ranks will thereby be inspired with an
honorable spirit of emulation, and an eager desire of distinguishing
themselves in their country’s service.</div>

<p>“Under the blessing of Divine Providence, His Majesty
ascribes the successes that have attended the exertions of his
troops in Egypt to that determined bravery which is inherent
in Britons; but His Majesty desires it may be most solemnly
and most forcibly impressed on the consideration of every
part of the army, that it has been a strict observance of <em>order</em>,
<em>discipline</em>, and <em>military</em> system, which has given its full energy
to the native valour of the troops, and has enabled them
proudly to assert the superiority of the national military
character, in situations uncommonly arduous, and under circumstances
of peculiar difficulty.</p>

<p>“The illustrious example of their Commander cannot fail
to have made an indelible impression on the gallant troops, at
whose head, crowned with victory and glory, he terminated
his honorable career; and His Majesty trusts that a due
contemplation of the talents and virtues which he uniformly
displayed in the course of his valuable life, will for ever endear
the memory of <span class="smcap">Sir Ralph Abercromby</span> to the British army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief having thus
obeyed His Majesty’s commands, cannot forbear to avail himself
of this opportunity of recapitulating the leading features
of a series of operations so honorable to the British arms.</p>

<p>“The boldness of the approach to the coast of Aboukir, in
defiance of a powerful and well-directed artillery; the orderly
formation upon the beach, under the heaviest fire of grape and
musketry; the reception and repulse of the enemy’s cavalry
and infantry; the subsequent charge of our troops, which
decided the victory, and established a footing on the shores of
Egypt, are circumstances of glory never surpassed in the
military annals of the world.</p>

<p>“The advance of the army, on the 13th of March, towards
<span class="smcap">Alexandria</span>, presents the spectacle of a movement of infantry
through an open country, who, being attacked upon their
march, <em>formed</em>, and <em>repulsed</em> the enemy; then advanced in
line for three miles, engaged along their whole front, until
they drove the enemy to seek his safety under the protection
of his entrenched position. Such had been the order and
regularity of the advance.</p>

<p>“Upon the 21st of March, the united force of the French
in Egypt attacked the position of the British army.</p>

<p>“An attack, begun an hour before daylight, could derive
no advantage over the vigilance of an army ever ready to receive
it. The enemy’s most vigorous and repeated efforts
were directed against the right and centre. Our infantry
fought in the plain, greatly inferior in the number of their
artillery, and unaided by cavalry.</p>

<p>“They relied upon their discipline and their courage. The
desperate attacks of a veteran cavalry, joined to those of a
numerous infantry, which had vainly styled itself ‘<em>Invincible</em>,’
were everywhere repulsed; and a conflict the most severe
terminated in one of the most signal victories which ever
adorned the annals of the British nation.</p>

<p>“In bringing forward these details, the Commander-in-Chief
does not call upon the army merely <em>to admire</em> but <em>to emulate</em>
such conduct. Every soldier who feels for the honor of his
country, while he exults in events so splendid and important
in themselves, will henceforth have fresh motives for cherishing
and enforcing the practice of discipline, and by uniting, in the
greatest perfection, order and precision with activity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
courage, will seek to uphold, and transmit undiminished to
posterity, the <em>Glory</em> and <em>Honor</em> of the <i>British Arms</i>.</p>

<p>“Nor is a less useful example to be derived from the conduct
of the distinguished Commander who fell in the field.
His steady observance of discipline, his ever-watchful attention
to the health and wants of his troops, the persevering and unconquerable
spirit which marked his military career, the
splendour of his actions in the field, and the heroism of his
death, are worthy the imitation of all who desire, like him,
a life of honor and a death of glory.</p>

<p>“By Order of His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief,</p>

<span class="padr4">“<i>18th January, 1809.</i></span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Orders.</span></p>

<p>“The irreparable loss that has been sustained by the fall of
the Commander of the Forces (Lieut.-General Sir John
Moore), and the severe wound which has removed Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird from his station, render it the
duty of Lieut.-General Hope <ins class="corr" id="tn-142" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'to congratulute the'">
to congratulate the</ins> army upon
the successful result of the action of the 16th instant.</p>

<p>“On no occasion has the undaunted valour <ins class="corr" id="tn-142a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of British troop'">
of British troops</ins> ever been more manifest. At the termination of a severe and
harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority which
the enemy had acquired, and which had materially impaired
the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages were to be
encountered.</p>

<p>“These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the troops
themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that whatever
advantages of position, or of numbers he may employ, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers, a bravery that
knows not how to yield, that no circumstances can appal,
and that will ensure victory when it is to be obtained by the
exertion of any human means.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General has the greatest satisfaction in distinguishing
such meritorious services, as came within his observation,
or have been brought to his knowledge.</p>

<p>“His acknowledgments are, in a peculiar manner, due to
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, and the brigade
under his command, consisting of the fourth, forty-second,
and fiftieth regiments, and which sustained the weight of the
attack.</p>

<p>“Major-General Manningham, with his brigade, consisting
of the Royals, the twenty-sixth and eighty-first regiments, and
Major-General Warde, with the brigade of Guards, will also
be pleased to accept his best thanks for their steady and gallant
conduct during the action.</p>

<p>“To Major-General Paget, who, by a judicious movement
of the reserve, effectually contributed to check the progress of
the enemy on the right; and to the first battalion of the fifty-second
and ninety-fifth regiments, which were thereby engaged,
the greatest praise is justly due.</p>

<p>“That part of Major-General Leith’s brigade which was
engaged, consisting of the fifty-ninth regiment, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the conduct of the Major-General, also claims marked approbation.</p>

<p>“The enemy not having rendered the attack on the left a
serious one, did not afford to the troops stationed in that
quarter an opportunity of displaying that gallantry which
must have made him repent the attempt.</p>

<p>“The piquets and advanced posts, however, of the brigades
under the command of <i>Major-Generals Hill and Leith</i>, and
<i>Colonel Catlin Craufurd</i>, conducted themselves with determined
resolution; and were ably supported by the officers
commanding these brigades, and by the troops of which they
were composed.</p>

<p>“It is peculiarly incumbent upon the Lieut.-General to
notice the vigorous attack made by the second battalion of the
<i>fourteenth</i> regiment under <i>Lieut.-Colonel Nicolls</i>, which drove
the enemy out of the village, of the left of which he had
possessed himself.</p>

<p>“The exertions of <i>Lieut.-Colonel Murray</i>, Quarter-Master
General, and of the other officers of the General Staff, during
the action, were unremitted, and deserve every degree of
approbation.</p>

<p>“The illness of <i>Brigadier-General Clinton</i>, Adjutant-General,
unfortunately deprived the army of the benefit of his
services.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General hopes the loss in point of numbers is
not so considerable as might have been expected; he laments,
however, the fall of the gallant soldiers and valuable officers
who have suffered.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General knows that it is impossible, in any
language he can use, to enhance the esteem, or diminish the
regret, that the army feels with him for its late Commander.
His career has been unfortunately too limited for his country,
but has been sufficient for his own fame. Beloved by the
army, honored by his Sovereign, and respected by his country,
he has terminated a life devoted to her service, by a glorious
death,—leaving his name as a memorial, an example, and an
incitement, to those who shall follow him in the path of honor,
and it is from his country alone that his memory can receive
the tribute which is its due.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Orders.</span></p>

<p>“The benefits derived to an army from the example of a
distinguished Commander, do not terminate at his death; his
virtues live in the recollection of his associates, and his fame
remains the strongest incentive to great and glorious actions.</p>

<p>“In this view, the Commander-in-Chief, amidst the deep and
universal regret which the death of Lieut.-General Sir <span class="smcap">John
Moore</span> has occasioned, recalls to the troops the military
career of that illustrious officer for their instruction and
imitation.</p>

<p>“Sir <span class="smcap">John Moore</span> from his youth embraced the profession
with the feelings and sentiments of a soldier; he felt that a
perfect knowledge, and an exact performance of the humble,
but important duties of a subaltern officer, are the best foundations
for subsequent military fame; and his ardent mind,
while it looked forward to those brilliant achievements for
which it was formed, applied itself, with energy and exemplary
assiduity, to the duties of that station.</p>

<p>“In the school of regimental duty, he obtained that correct
knowledge of his profession so essential to the proper direction
of the gallant spirit of the soldier; and he was enabled to
establish a characteristic order and regularity of conduct, because
the troops found in their leader a striking example of
the discipline which he enforced on others.</p>

<p>“Having risen to command, he signalized his name in the
West Indies, in Holland, and in Egypt. The unremitting
attention with which he devoted himself to the duties of every
branch of his profession, obtained him the confidence of Sir
Ralph Abercromby, and he became the companion in arms of
that illustrious officer, who fell at the head of his victorious
troops, in an action which maintained our national superiority
over the arms of France.</p>

<p>“Thus Sir <span class="smcap">John Moore</span> at an early period obtained, with
general approbation, that conspicuous station, in which he
gloriously terminated his useful and honorable life.</p>

<p>“In a military character obtained amidst the dangers of
climate, the privations incident to service, and the sufferings
of repeated wounds, it is difficult to select any one point as
a preferable subject for praise; it exhibits, however, one
feature so particularly characteristic of the man, and so important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
to the best interests of the service, that the Commander-in-Chief
is pleased to mark it with his peculiar approbation—</p>

<p class="pad4">“<span class="smcap">The life of SIR JOHN MOORE was spent among the troops.</span></p>

<p>“During the season of repose, his time was devoted to the
care and instruction of the officer and soldier; in war he
courted service in every quarter of the globe. Regardless of
personal considerations, he esteemed that to which his
country called him, <em>the post of honor</em>, and by his undaunted
spirit and unconquerable perseverance, he pointed the way to
victory.</p>

<p>“His country, the object of his latest solicitude, will rear a
monument to his lamented memory, and the Commander-in-Chief
feels he is paying the best tribute to his fame by thus
holding him forth as an <span class="smcap">Example</span> to the <span class="smcap">Army</span>.</p>
